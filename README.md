# GHPR raw data
Raw data for the [GHPR dataset](https://github.com/soroushj/ghpr-dataset).

This repository contains JSON files that represent issues and pull requests included in the GHPR dataset.
These files are generated by the [GHPR Crawler](https://github.com/soroushj/ghpr-tools#ghpr-crawler).

The naming pattern for the files is as follows:
- `/repos/OWNER/REPO/issue-N.json` for issues, e.g., [`/repos/goharbor/harbor/issue-8319.json`](./repos/goharbor/harbor/issue-8319.json)
- `/repos/OWNER/REPO/pull-N.json` for pull requests, e.g., [`/repos/goharbor/harbor/pull-8425.json`](./repos/goharbor/harbor/pull-8425.json)

These JSON objects come from the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest), with one change:
Pull request objects found here have an additional `linked_issue_numbers` property, which is a list of issue numbers in the same repository linked by the pull request using a [GitHub keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).
