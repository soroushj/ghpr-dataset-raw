  "body": "### Target\r\nBasically, we would like to support a configuration that target only local DNS request, but for both Ipv4 and Ipv6 stacks.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.:53 {\r\n  bind 127.0.0.1\r\n  .. whatever config here ...\r\n  proxy 8.8.8.8:53\r\n}\r\n\r\n.:53 {\r\n  bind ::1\r\n  .. whatever config here ...\r\n  proxy 8.8.8.8:53\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue: there is an initial validation of the headers of bloc-lists that prevent to listen the same domains on the same port ... *but the listening address is not included*.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that this check is done *before* the configuration is setup. It is based *only* on the headers of the blocs.\r\n\r\n### Proposition\r\n\r\nMove up the bind address in the header, in a compatible way with today's syntax.\r\nSomething like : <domain>:IP:Port\r\nif the IP is not present, then <domain>:Port would be understood.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Bind is still supported, it would overwrite the proposed address in the header.\r\n(no change in the BIND plugin).\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nI think that it is enough to modify the function that parse and check the header of each ServerBlock in the function InspectServerBlocks of core/dnsserver/register.go\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
