So I found this line in our logging system:\r\n\r\n log: / /___/ /_/ / /  /  __/ /_/ / /|  /___/ / \r\n\r\nIt took me a frustrating amount of time (and insights from a colleague) to figure out that this was not some kind of debugging output...\r\nI love ASCII art too but how about a boring line with the Version number indicating CoreDNS is starting up \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ? \r\n",
