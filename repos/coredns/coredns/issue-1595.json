  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting for me to have the route 53 support other RR types than A and AAAA. I'm specifically interested in PTR records and zones.\r\n\r\nSo I'm trying to understand what, if any, issues there may be in expanding the functionality of the plugin.\r\n\r\nLooking at the plugin implementation, it seems it should be possible to expand with functions handling the additional types. But I don't have much experience with neither the Route 53 API, CoreDNS or Go, so that may just be my unawareness getting in the way.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts? Consider this an invite for discussion :)",
