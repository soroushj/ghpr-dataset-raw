  "body": "In coredns 1.2.6, for a domain with services with empty `Host` fields, various queries (tested with `CNAME`, `A`, and `SRV` lookups) will contain answers with the domain `.`. The correct behaviour for this seems to be to skip all services that have an empty `Host` field for all queries other than `TXT`. For domains that have no other services defined, this should also work, since the expected result here is a NODATA response.\r\n\r\nInitial discussion in PR #2425 ",
