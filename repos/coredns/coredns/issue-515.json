  "body": "The rewrite middleware has `fallthrough` (at my request) to allows for falling through to the next middleware *even though* this middleware should be authoritative for this name.\r\n\r\nq: should we keep something like `fallthrough` or just allow it? I'm not sure about the ramifications, but my gut feeling says that just allowing it can lead to weird to debug DNS issues... (and God forbid, maybe loops).\r\nI'm also a fan of keeping things explicit; hence I think I'm in favor of keeping it.",
