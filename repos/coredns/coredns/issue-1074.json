  "body": "Currently, you can specify a reverse zone in the Corefile with the CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8). However, if the network is not on a classful boundary, it is silently ignored.\r\n\r\nIn the K8s use cases in particular, we would like to be able to serve PTR records for the address space that K8s manages, but proxy other PTR requests upstream. This is how the `cidrs` feature worked in the past, before we added the CIDR notation for zones.\r\n\r\nI think that if there is a classless zone defined, we could automatically round it to the containing classful boundary. We could retain the original CIDR though, and in the middleware we can test if the request falls outside that original CIDR. If so, we `fallthrough`. This could be automatic or it could be an option we set on a given middleware (e.g., `ptr_fallthrough` or something).\r\n\r\nIf multiple reverse zone CIDRs are listed in the ZONES, then we should find the minimal set of containing classful zones and adjust to those, storing away all the specific CIDRs.\r\n\r\nThe end logic of doing the PTR fall through would need to be implemented in each middleware, but most of this should be able to be done in a pkg to make it easy to implement per middleware.",
