  "body": "`fallthrough` is an escape hatch that should not be used lightly. Currently a few plugins use it, some of a good reasons, others not so much:\r\n\r\n* *hosts*: per definition of how `/etc/hosts` works, this make sense to allow fallthrough\r\n* *template*: \"Continue with the next plugin if the zone matched but no regex matched', looks legit, but can be done with a wildcard match, or an identify function.\r\n* *route53*: \"If zone matches and no record can be generated, pass request to the next plugin\", looks borderline?\r\n* *etcd*, same text as *route53*, looks *very* borderline\r\n* *kubernetes*, *very* borderline.\r\n\r\nThe problem with fallthrough is that it makes writing a wrong Corefile easy; this causes extra load and makes a query to be handled by, essentially, the wrong plugin. It also goes against the DNS; as an authoritative plugin (the one that handles the zone) should provide an answer. `fallthrough` encourages plugins to handle 1/2 a zone.\r\n\r\n*Hosts* should def. keep it. In *etcd* and *kubernetes* it can be removed. Use in *template* looks ok. I'm not sure about *route53*.",
