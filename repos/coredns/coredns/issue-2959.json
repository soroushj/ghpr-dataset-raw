  "body": "I'm putting out notifications on all Caddy plugins about an unexpectedly-breaking change... sorry. I am not 100% sure it is relevant to this project, but in case it is, here you go:\r\n\r\nCaddy's import path (and Go module name) has changed from\r\n\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/mholt/caddy\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/caddyserver/caddy\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Go modules are not yet mature enough to handle a change like this (see https://golang.org/issue/26904 - \"haven't implemented that part yet\" but high on priority list for Go _1.14_) which caught me off-guard. Using Go module's `replace` feature didn't act the way I expected, either. Caddy now fails to build with plugins until they update their import paths.\r\n\r\nI've hacked a fix into the build server, so downloading Caddy with your plugin from our website should continue working without any changes on your part, for now. However, please take a moment and update your import paths, and do a new deploy on the website, because the workaround involves ignoring module checksums and performing a delicate recursive search-and-replace.\r\n\r\nI'm terribly sorry about this. I did a number of tests and dry-runs to ensure the change would be smooth, but apparently some unknown combination of GOPATH, Go modules' lack of maturity, and other hidden variables in the system or environment must have covered up something I missed.\r\n\r\nThis bash script should make it easy (run it from your project's top-level directory):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfind . -name '*.go' | while read -r f; do\r\n\tsed -i.bak 's/\\/mholt\\/caddy/\\/caddyserver\\/caddy/g' $f && rm $f.bak\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use this script in the build server as part of the temporary workaround.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions! Sorry again for the inconvenience.",
