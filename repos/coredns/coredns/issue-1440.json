  "body": "With a minimal proxy config not setting a HTTP healthcheck endpoint, an upstream host which had occassionally issues will eventually be marked down forever, without the chance to recover.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that CoreDNS will implicitly activate HTTP healthchecks even if not configured. Most common DNS recursors don't provide a HTTP healtcheck interface and will therefore fail these healthchecks.\r\n\r\nThis is quite critical and has caused a small outage for us.",
