  "body": "**Partial middleware chain execution vs full** - Autopath search path execution passes non-kubernetes searches to next middleware.  This excludes those queries from processing by any middleware occurring upstream of kubernetes in the chain.  However if the client was executing these, then each query would be passed through the whole chain.\r\n\r\n**Cache race condition** - It's possible for pods in different namespaces to get a different answer for the same question.  This causes a problem with cache - a pod can get another pods cached result.  \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\npod in ns ns1: `host google.com` receives ...\r\n  `google.com.ns1.zone. IN CNAME google.com.`\r\n  `google.com IN A 1.2.3.4`\r\n\r\n\r\npod in ns ns2: `host google.com.ns1.zone.` receives cached result\u2026\r\n  `google.com.ns1.zone. IN CNAME google.com.`\r\n  `google.com IN A 1.2.3.4`\r\n\r\nbut should have received NXDOMAIN.",
