  "body": "We have introduced this feature some time ago - see #1659, #1680, #1889.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this was faster retrying in case of lost UDP query/response (i/o timeout) and having more attempts to retry in 5s interval, see also closed #1624\r\n\r\nHowever, now I think this feature doesn't work fine in many cases and may be a reason for troubles like #2265. \r\n\r\nThis is because we cannot reliably predict a reasonable timeout for next query based on RTT of previous queries. The time needed to resolve domain name varies significantly between different queries. It may depend on how many labels the queried domain name has, or which records have already been cached (or evicted from cache) on resolver side, or how responsive authoritative domain name servers for particular zone, the protocol used (UPD or TCP), etc\r\n\r\nSo, I propose to remove dynamic read timeout logic. I would also prefer to have the query timeout value configurable. I know @miekg you don't like knobs like this, but IMO this option would be really helpful for many people, since the timeout is highly dependent on environment in which coredns works, and we cannot predefine an ideal constant which would work perfectly for everyone.\r\n\r\nAs for similar feature for dynamic dial timeout (#1852) we may want to keep it, since dialTimeout doesn't depend on queried domain and dialing time may give more consistent values.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n",
