  "body": "The initial idea is from #1520 , and we want to add a metric to monitor if the plugin `rewrite` is enabled.  @greenpau discussed this with me, and we think it would be better to have a global metric named `pulgin_enabled{server, name}`, so we can easily monitor all enabled plugins. \r\n\r\nI would like to work on this, but I don't really know how to get the list of enabled plugins. Does anyone know how to do that? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJiacheng",
