The time has come to clean this up in all plugins:\r\n\r\n* for the time being allow `upstream` and any parameters, but ignore it entirely, so set a `upstream.New` in the code (this may or may not have been already done - haven't checked)\r\n\r\n* some time later; remove upstream as a config option from each of the plugins and default to erroring when we see it.",
