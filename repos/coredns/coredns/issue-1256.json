  "body": "I have a unique scenario where I would like to deploy multiple CoreDNS servers in a cluster. I want each CoreDNS server in the cluster to expose certain information like label or meta-data.\r\n\r\nCoreDNS currently support whoami plugin that could be used to show the local IP of the CoreDNS server. Though it would be nice to allow CoreDNS to be assigned with a arbitrary label or metadata and expose it through DNS or HTTP.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I want to deploy 3 CoreDNS servers on 3 hosts. One host is deployed in Tokyo and another two hosts are deployed in California. I would like to have the first host with the label of:\r\n`location=tokyo` and the rest two host with the label of: `location=california`.\r\n\r\nA feature like the above will helps a lot in a distributed system and expand the usage of CoreDNS in more interesting ways.\r\n",
