  "body": "**Expected behavior and actual behavior:**\r\nWhen pulling an image from a ProxyCache project that doesn't exist in the cache, the image gets pulled from the upstream registry and served to the client, however the Pull Time for this image is not updated (Pull Time remains empty), if the image is not pulled again by another client it will be marked for deletion by the default retention rule since it meets the criteria \"wasn't pulled during last 7 days\".\r\n\r\nI would expect to the Pull Time (and Pull Count ?) to be updated during the initial load of the artifact when the `proxy-cache-service` creates the artifact in the ProxyCache project.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the problem:**\r\n\r\n1. Create a ProxyCache project (we used a Docker Hub registry endpoint)\r\n2. pull only once an image that doesn't currently exist in the Project repos\r\n3. make sure the image is pulled by the client and can be seen in the Project's repositories\r\n4. notice that Pull Time has an empty value\r\n5. run a DRY RUN for the project's default retention rule and check the log, this image should have a `DEL` retention result.\r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\nPlease specify the versions of following systems.\r\n\r\n- harbor version: v2.1.0\r\n- docker engine version: 19.03.12\r\n- docker-compose version: 1.27.2\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\n\r\nN/A, happy to provide additional info as requested.\r\n\r\n/cc @jonasrosland following our slack chat.",
