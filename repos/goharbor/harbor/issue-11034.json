  "body": "**Expected behavior and actual behavior:**\r\nI found this bug while watching a customer at the keyboard so I don't have screenshots.\r\nWe were following these steps\r\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/1.10/administration/configure-authentication/ldap-auth.md\r\n\r\nWhen you are setting up Harbor LDAP integration, there is a button that says \"Test LDAP Server\"\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**: If the settings are wrong, the user is notified the settings are wrong. If the settings are correct, the user is notified that the settings are correct.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**: If the settings are wrong, nothing happens. If the settings are correct, the user is notified that the settings are correct.\r\n\r\nThis means the customer has no idea if they are doing it right until they do it right. With no feedback when the settings are incorrect, the customer might think the settings are correct and waste time trying to use the LDAP integration that is in fact incorrect.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the problem:**\r\nGo to Administration -> Configuration -> Authentication\r\nSelect LDAP\r\nEnter in your LDAP connection settings into the fields\r\nPush \"Test LDAP Server\"\r\n\r\n**Versions:**\r\n- harbor version: 1.10.1\r\n- docker engine version: unrelated\r\n- docker-compose version: unrelated\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\nThis is purely a UX bug. We eventually got the LDAP settings correct which caused us to be informed by the UI that we got the settings correct. If we never got them correct we would have always been wondering if the settings were correct or not.\r\n",
