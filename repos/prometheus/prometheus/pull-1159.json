  "body": "This change is breaking, use the 'bool' modifier for such comprisons.\n\nAfter this change all comparisons without 'bool' will filter, and all\ncomparisons with 'bool' will return 0/1. This makes the language more\nconsistent and orthogonal, and ultimately easier to learn and use.\n\nIf we ever figure out sane semantics for filtering scalar/scalar\ncomparisons we can add them in, which will most likely come out of how\nthe new vector() function is used.\n\nFixes #482 @juliusv @fabxc \n",
