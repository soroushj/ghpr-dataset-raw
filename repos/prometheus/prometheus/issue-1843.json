  "body": "The remote storage queue manager fires off concurrent requests to send sample batches to the remote storage: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/e980913cd69a85d9644ffd0d0cfeb26633e9f983/storage/remote/queue_manager.go#L183-L204\n\nThis causes samples to be sent out-of-order, which the receiving side might not be equipped to handle. Not sure what's going to happen with this interface in general, but if it's generally going to stay, we should consider removing the parallelism (or make it configurable in case people have a backend that doesn't care?).\n",
