Why is this important?**\r\nSometimes badly composed query could return a lot of result rows. To remove that result user needs to scroll to the bottom of the page and press on \"Remove graph\" link. It could be a problem is query returned couple of thousands of result rows.\r\n\r\n*\u201cNice to have\u201d is not a good use case. :)*\r\nIt would be nice to place that link near to query area, so user could clear results without scrolling the page.",
