  "body": "The way we're hiding secrets in configs is based on a regex that hides the secret as long as it's on the same line as the field name.\r\n\r\nThis breaks if the secret is spread across multiple lines, such as is common with SSL certs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should either hide secrets in all cases, or in no cases to avoid giving a false sense of security.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to do this would be to re-marshall the YAML with secrets elided. This will however lose all comments, as there doesn't appear to be a Go YAML library that preserves comments.\r\nOn the minor plus side we'd be more likely to notice certain rare YAML formatting mistakes.",
