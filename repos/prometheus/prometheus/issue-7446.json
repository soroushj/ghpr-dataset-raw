  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI use Prometheus in a monitoring project for my Company. The security team opened a vulnerability issue because on 9090 port they see a JQuery version below 3.5. They reported the following security report:\r\nhttps://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/136929\r\nthat suggests upgrading to 3.5\r\n\r\nIf you follow the link inside you arrive here:\r\nhttps://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/\r\n\r\nIf I well understand the problem, it is related to the use of a special HTML tag. It's clear that to fix the security issue you need to upgrade to 3.5 or just report that you don't use that tag.\r\n\r\nNow looking at the commit history there is this commit, where it seems the fix is present.\r\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/commit/c7d9516695c51cdb2185166e34c8190feca0fdf8\r\n\r\nthe commit was included 26 days ago. I tried the Prometheus 2.19.1 (built 6 days ago) and I verified it includes JQuery 3.3.1. \r\n\r\nTo verify this I did:\r\n1. install Prometheus 2.19.1\r\n2. start the server\r\n3. Access to localhost:9090 with Chrome\r\n4. Right-click->Inspect and click on Console tab\r\n5. Enter this command: console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery);\r\n\r\nit reports 3.3.1. My question is: why I do not have evidence that Prometheus 2.19.1 uses JQuery 3.5? If JQuery 3.5 is not included in 2.19.1, can you tell me whether the security exposure affects Prometheus or not? If so, when do you think it will be solved?\r\nThank you in advance for help.",
