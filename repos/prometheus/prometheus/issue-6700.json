Therefore pkg.gate, called in engine.exec can never fail.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/d996ba20ec9c7f1808823a047ed9d5ce96be3d8f/promql/engine.go#L193-L196\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/d996ba20ec9c7f1808823a047ed9d5ce96be3d8f/promql/query_logger.go#L178\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that now queries will no longer fail in \"wait queue\" for timeout, as the active query tracker is called before we have set a deadline on the context.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/d996ba20ec9c7f1808823a047ed9d5ce96be3d8f/promql/engine.go#L193-L199\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/d996ba20ec9c7f1808823a047ed9d5ce96be3d8f/promql/engine.go#L430-L435",
