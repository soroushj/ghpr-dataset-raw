  "body": "Fixes #6285 \r\n\r\nThis PR updates the promtool unit testing framework to parse the yaml files with `model.Duration` instead of `time.Duration`. This allows the code to support durations such as `1d` or `1w` and brings this implementation closer to what a user would expect as it matches the supported durations of other prometheus config files.\r\n\r\nI'm open to feedback on if there is a more go idiomatic way of performing this fix, rather then doing `time.Duration(model.Duration)` in several places in the code as I've done here.",
