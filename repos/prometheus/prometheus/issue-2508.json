  "body": "I'd like to propose passing the scrape timeout down as a header when scraping. For exporters like snmp and blackbox it'd be good if the user didn't have to set timeouts in two places. More generally for expensive exporters, it'd be good to stop querying when the other side has given up. Whether this would ever be exposed to client libraries is a separate question.\r\n\r\nThis would be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nScrape-Timeout-Seconds: 10.0 \r\n```",
