  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n**What did you do?**\r\nI'm able to kill a prometheus server. I've read the Prometheus [security model](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/security/) and I can violate:\r\n> It is more likely that a component will be accidentally taken out by a trusted user than by malicious action.\r\n\r\nSo I reached out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_aead_/status/1004404417267986433) to ask how to report a security issue for Prometheus but got no response.\r\n\r\nI did not disclose details since I don't know how the disclosure policy looks like - I can disclose the vulnerability in this issue if you want to.    \r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nI should not be able to kill a prometheus server the way I can at the moment. \r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\nI can kill (arbitrary) prometheus servers (AFAICT).\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version:\r\n\r\n`prometheus version 2.2.1` (locally verified)\r\n\r\nOlder versions are affected too and I think the latest version 2.3.0 as well (but I haven't verified this)\r\n",
