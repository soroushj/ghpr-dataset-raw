  "body": "@brancz , @SuperQ do you remember why we run `make test` against .1.10 and 1.x? \r\n\r\nIt seems that we always update the second target (currently 1.10.x) to latest stable anyway so we are running against the same versions on both targets most of the time.\r\n\r\nThere are some gofmt changes in 1.13 and Travis has some bug in travis that returns 1.13 for 1.x where it should return latest stable, but my question is should we just run 1.10 or at least run `make style` only for the laster golang stable.?",
