  "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\nIf I click a hash-fragment link in the prometheus targets web UI, currently the header disappears behind the header.\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:9090/targets#job-domain_exporter\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the nav header not occlude the link. This would make it easier to link to parts of the page and see the context.\r\n\r\nMajor browsers seem to have a way to solve this with CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nhtml {\r\n    scroll-padding-top: 56px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBrowser support is pretty good: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-padding-top.\r\n\r\nI applied this the other day to https://graphviz.org/ which was having the same problem, and it's working well.",
