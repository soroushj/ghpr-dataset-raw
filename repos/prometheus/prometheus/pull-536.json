  "body": "This allows changing the time offset for individual instant and range\nvectors in a query.\n\nFor example, this returns the value of `foo` 5 minutes in the past\nrelative to the current query evaluation time:\n\n```\nfoo offset 5m\n```\n\nNote that the `offset` modifier always needs to follow the selector\nimmediately. I.e. the following would be correct:\n\n```\nsum(foo offset 5m) // GOOD.\n```\n\nWhile the following would be _incorrect_:\n\n```\nsum(foo) offset 5m // INVALID.\n```\n\nThe same works for range vectors. This returns the 5-minutes-rate that\n`foo` had a week ago:\n\n```\nrate(foo[5m] offset 1w) \n```\n\nThis change touches the following components:\n- Lexer/parser: additions to correctly parse the new `offset`/`OFFSET`\n  keyword.\n- AST: vector and matrix nodes now have an additional `offset` field.\n  This is used during their evaluation to adjust query and result times\n  appropriately.\n- Query analyzer: now works on separate sets of ranges and instants per \n  offset. Isolating different offsets from each other completely in this\n  way keeps the preloading code relatively simple.\n\nNo storage engine changes were needed by this change.\n\nThe rules tests have been changed to not probe the internal\nimplementation details of the query analyzer anymore (how many instants\nand ranges have been preloaded). This would also become too cumbersome\nto test with the new model, and measuring the result of the query should\nbe sufficient.\n\nThis fixes https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/529\nThis fixed https://github.com/prometheus/promdash/issues/201\n",
