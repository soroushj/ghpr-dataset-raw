  "body": "Fixes #4629 \r\n\r\nSince it is [used in a type assertion](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/3e87c04/web/api/v1/api.go#L265-L271), having `ErrStorage` as an alias to the error interface is the same as saying `error`, i.e. it succeeds for all types of error.  Change to a struct which is a concrete type and the type assertion will only succeed if the type is identical.\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions\r\n\r\nThis change will break downstream projects that are using the type, but I argue they can't be using it to any great benefit as it stands.",
