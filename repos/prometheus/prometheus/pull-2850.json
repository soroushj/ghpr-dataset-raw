  "body": "Fixes #2811, fixes #2845\r\n\r\nA _very_ early PR - I expect to need another week or so before this is ready to review.  Feel free to take a look at the overall direction, but lets hold of on any smaller issues of nitpicking for now.\r\n\r\nThings that needs addressing:\r\n- ~This PR completely disabled the append fast path, which is clearly not good enough.~\r\n- Probably want to add fast paths for common cases (no remote, only one remote etc)\r\n- Still using the old `model.*` data types on the remote write path, need to update these to the new `labels` types.\r\n- ~The read path is completely untested, and will need plenty of new unit tests for the merging iterators.~\r\n- Contexts need plumbing through, although will probably do this on a different PR.\r\n",
