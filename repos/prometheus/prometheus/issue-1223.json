  "body": "Having problems with \"offset\" in recorded rules and alerts.\n\nFull expression works in templates and expression browser, but when a recorded rule or alert rule, \"offset\" gets ignored.\n\nFor example, with these two rules.  Evaluating the two new timeseries in the browser, they always report the same number -- and on the status page rule list there's no mention of \"offset\"\n\n```\nnet_total_rate = sum(rate(node_network_receive_bytes{device=\"eth0\"}[5m])) * 8\nnet_total_rate_offset = sum(rate(node_network_receive_bytes{device=\"eth0\"}[5m] offset 1m)) * 8\n```\n\n---\n\nScreenshot of status page, note missing \"offset\" keyword on the right hand side:\n\n![prom_1_rules](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1072753/11166592/e60f3366-8aef-11e5-968e-4d1a7d658f87.png)\n\n---\n\nScreenshot of first rule:\n\n![prom_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1072753/11166593/f07c5586-8aef-11e5-8af9-4e82e44500d2.png)\n\nScreenshot of offset rule, note that the value is reported as the same, it should not be:\n\n![prom_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1072753/11166594/0222d864-8af0-11e5-9f60-7cf7f7c56e0e.png)\n\n---\n\nEvaluating the expression in the browser itself works, and the \"offset\" version does report the offset:\n\n![prom_4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1072753/11166595/10db8c48-8af0-11e5-88ae-b8e78f45f450.png)\n\n![prom_5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1072753/11166596/1eed9e7a-8af0-11e5-88a8-9eec87c67338.png)\n\n---\n\nThe above examples use \"offset 1m\", but the same issue persists with 5m, 30m, ... the recorded rules don't use the offset.\n(fyi this test prometheus instance has scrape/evaluation intervals of 5s)\n",
