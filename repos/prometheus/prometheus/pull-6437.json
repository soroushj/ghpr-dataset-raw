  "body": "This Pull Request fixes a bug in the querying behavior of the new React UI. The bug is described in the linked issue.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the bug was the state management strategy in `ExpressionInput`. Previously, the query expression was passed into `ExpressionInput` as a prop, then stored as internal component state. When the query expression was changed, the parent components (which actually do the fetching) were not aware of the state changes. So when they performed a fetch, they sometimes used a stale query expression. Specifically, the query expression was stale whenever a query was executed without using the Execute button.\r\n\r\nThe solution I propose here is to lift the state management back into the parent components\u2014`Panel` and `PanelList`\u2014 so that they know when the query expression changes and fetch using up-to-date values. In addition, I decouple state changes from querying so that each expression input keystroke does _not_ issue a new query. State changes that should perform queries do so in the lifecycle method `componentDidUpdate`. And every time a query is executed, the url is updated. This matches the behavior of the existing classic ui.\r\n\r\nFixes #6405",
