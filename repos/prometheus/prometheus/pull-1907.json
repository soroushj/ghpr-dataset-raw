  "body": "Also, remove unused `providers` field in targetSet.\n\nIf the config file changes, we recreate all providers (by calling\n`providersFromConfig`) and retrieve all targets anew from the newly\ncreated providers. From that perspective, it cannot harm to clean up\nthe target group map in the targetSet. Not doing so (as it was the\ncase so far) keeps stale targets around. This mattered if an existing\nkey in the target group map was not overwritten in the initial fetch\nof all targets from the providers. Examples where that mattered:\n\n```\nscrape_configs:\n- job_name: \"foo\"\n  static_configs:\n  - targets: [\"foo:9090\"]\n  - targets: [\"bar:9090\"]\n```\n\nupdated to:\n\n```\nscrape_configs:\n- job_name: \"foo\"\n  static_configs:\n  - targets: [\"foo:9090\"]\n```\n\n`bar:9090` would still be monitored. (The static provider just\nenumerates the target groups. If the number of target groups\ndecreases, the old ones stay around.\n\n```\nscrape_configs:\n- job_name: \"foo\"\n  dns_sd_configs:\n  - names:\n    - \"srv.name.one.example.org\"\n```\n\nupdated to:\n\n```\nscrape_configs:\n- job_name: \"foo\"\n  dns_sd_configs:\n  - names:\n    - \"srv.name.two.example.org\"\n```\n\nNow both SRV records are still monitored. The SRV name is part of the\nkey in the target group map, thus the new one is just added and the\nold ane stays around.\n\nObviously, this should have tests, and should have tests before, not\nonly for this case. This is the quick fix. I have created\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1906 to track test\ncreation.\n\nFixes https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1610 .\n\n@matthiasr @fabxc \n",
