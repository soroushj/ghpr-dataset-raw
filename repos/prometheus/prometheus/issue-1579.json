  "body": "I am trying to upgrade from Prometheus 0.17.0 to 0.18.0 and noticed that Prometheus is failing to start due to:\n\n`2016-04-22_23:43:36.52662 time=\"2016-04-22T23:43:36Z\" level=error msg=\"invalid Alertmanager URL: http://prometheus-alertmanager.service.q:9093\" source=\"main.go:65\"`\n\nI first thought Prometheus couldn't resolve the URL, but after doing some straces, I didn't even see Prometheus trying to resolve the name. Prometheus 0.18.0 currently doesn't like it when there is a single character after the last `.` of the URL. Maybe there is regex in Prometheus which is assuming that all URLs will be FQDN and there are no single character TLDs?\n\nWorks:\n`http://prometheus-alertmanager.t.te`\n\nDoesn't work:\n`http://prometheus-alertmanager.t.t`\n",
