  "body": "Relabelling has a lot of irreducible complexity due to the abundance of different configurations we must allow for, however I think there's some scope for making the syntax a little easier.\n\nI propose that we default the regex to `(.*)` and the replacement to `$1`. The effect of this is that copies and setting static labels will both be much easier, both of which are very common uses.\n\n```\n- regex: .*\n  replacement: staticvalue\n  target_label: myLabel\n- source_labels: [src]\n  regex: (.*)\n  replacement: $1\n  target_label: myLabel\n```\n\nwould become\n\n```\n- replacement: staticvalue\n  target_label: myLabel\n- source_labels: [src]\n  target_label: myLabel\n```\n\nThis is a small bit magic which may cause confusion, but overall I think it'd be a benefit.\n\n@fabxc @beorn7 @juliusv \n",
