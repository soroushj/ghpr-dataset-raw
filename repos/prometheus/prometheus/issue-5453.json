  "body": "## Proposal\r\n**Use case. Why is this important?**\r\n\r\nRight now there are prometheus naming best practices documented in both [the docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/) and blog posts such as [Robust Perception](https://www.robustperception.io/on-the-naming-of-things). I propose that as many of these conventions as possible should be codified in the `promtool check metrics` tool.\r\n\r\nCurrently the promlint code includes rules for:\r\n* Help text\r\n* Using base units\r\n* Using misleading/inappropriate suffixes\r\n\r\nI propose that in addition there should be rules for:\r\n* Don't put the metric type in the name, such as `request_duration_seconds_histogram`\r\n* Don't use colons in metric names (reserved for recording rules)\r\n* Use `snake_case` not `camelCase`\r\n* Detection on `_s_` instead of `seconds`, `_b_` or `_kb_` instead of `_bytes_`\r\n\r\nI would love to hear other people's opinion on rules that should be added and am happy to change the list around.\r\n\r\nIf people think some or all of these new rules are a good idea I plan to do the implementation.\r\n\r\nThanks for thinking about this proposal!",
