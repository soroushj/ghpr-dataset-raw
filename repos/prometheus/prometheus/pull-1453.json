As any errors relevant here are most likely\ncaused by severe and unrecoverable problems with the series file,\nUsing the now quarantine feature is the right step. We don't really\nhave to be worried about any inconsistent state of the series because\nit will be removed for good ASAP. Another plus is that we don't have\nto declare the whole storage dirty anymore.\n\n@juliusv Welcome to depth level 5 of your review queue. :) This is another easy one...\n",
