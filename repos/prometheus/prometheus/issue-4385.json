Under which circumstances?**\r\nIf there was a single `NaN` in the time range then the value returned is NaN. I made an example test case (which fails) to showcase the issue: https://github.com/jacksontj/prometheus/commit/a36f35153d4c230847bbfe992992b1f78f492f37\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version:\r\n\r\n\tverified on 2.2, 2.3, and master",
