  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n**What did you do?**\r\nSomeone sent a large query such as `{__name__=~\".+\"}[5d]` to our prometheus host.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nI expect the query to timeout before completing, while consuming some memory and CPU along the way.\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\nThe query runs until it exhausts all available memory on the host and OOM killer get is. I have set it up in a repro env locally and the query has been running for ~60m (its still going) even though I have the timeout set to the default 2m.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version:\r\n\r\n2.2\r\n\r\nSame symptoms as #4288",
