  "body": "The idea is to make the retention decisions via an interface that also allows looking at each block. With this, the time based and size based retention logic would be a single interface for Prometheus and allow external users to inject different interfaces as retention filters.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly helpful for Cortex and Thanos who don't want some blocks to be deleted based on some conditions.\r\n\r\n/cc @pracucci @pstibrany @bwplotka @brancz ",
