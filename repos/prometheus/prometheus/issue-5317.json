  "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\nI originally added `promlint` for use in `promtool check metrics`. It is very useful for that purpose, however, it would also be nice to allow the package to be easily vendored and used in other applications for unit tests and such.\r\n\r\nBecause this main Prometheus repository is fairly large and also contains a great deal of unrelated code, I propose moving `util/promlint` to `github.com/prometheus/common/promlint` or similar. This way, library code lives with a library instead of an entire application, and is much easier to vendor.\r\n\r\nAt that point, we can vendor in the updated copy of `common` and switch the import statements used within `promtool`.",
