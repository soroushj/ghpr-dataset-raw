  "body": "**What did you do?**\r\n\r\nI implemented a remote_read interface for Prometheus in Java.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nI expected to receive Protobuf-encoded [remote ReadRequests](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/storage/remote/remote.proto) from Prometheus, but instead...\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\n\r\nInstead of the protobuf binary format, Prometheus' remote read requests are Snappy-compressed data.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is not stated in the Content-type, which says \"application/x-protobuf\" indicating that it is protobuf binary format, not Snappy.\r\n\r\nSecond, I am currently not aware of any Java implementation of the Snappy codec that can successfully decode golang-snappy encoded data (I tried both [xerial-snappy](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java) and [dain/snappy](https://github.com/dain/snappy) and could not make it decompress the golang-snappy encoded data).\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version: \r\n\r\n\t1.6.1\r\n\r\n* Prometheus configuration file:\r\n```\r\n# my global config\r\nglobal:\r\n  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.\r\n  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.\r\n  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).\r\n\r\n  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with\r\n  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).\r\n  external_labels:\r\n      monitor: 'codelab-monitor'\r\n\r\n# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.\r\nrule_files:\r\n  # - \"first.rules\"\r\n  # - \"second.rules\"\r\n\r\n# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:\r\n# Here it's Prometheus itself.\r\nscrape_configs:\r\n  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.\r\n  - job_name: 'prometheus'\r\n\r\n    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'\r\n    # scheme defaults to 'http'.\r\n\r\n    static_configs:\r\n      - targets: ['localhost:9090']\r\n\r\nremote_read:\r\n  - url: \"http://localhost:9201/read\"\r\n```\r\n",
