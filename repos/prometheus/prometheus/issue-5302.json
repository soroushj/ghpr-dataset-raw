Why is this important?**\r\n\r\nWhen Prometheus is federating another monitoring system, it could be that that monitoring system is exposing timestamps.\r\nIn the case of federation with timestamps, Prometheus will not mark the metric as stale if it disappear. Instead, it will be present up to the query.loopback value.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Open Metrics will not help\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/issues/37\r\n\r\nCould we have a *job option* honor_timestamps to discard timestamps? That way power user can deal with broken third parties.",
