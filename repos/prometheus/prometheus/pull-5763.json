  "body": "This includes three changes that help drastically with remote write shards flapping.\r\n1. `samplesPending` needs to be a rate like the other measurements. Otherwise the units when doing math don't work out. Previously the units for desired shards were `s * count`, giving seconds, now they are `s * count/s` giving a count.\r\n1. Accounting for `samplesIn` and `samplesPending` on line 461. Previously, whenever the queue caught up with data it would instantly think it needed zero shards which caused the crazy changes from min_shards to max_shards.\r\n1. Making the integral accumulator used again let the calculation avoid flapping between two moderate values.\r\n\r\ncc: @cstyan @tomwilkie This works well in my testing, but would appreciate this exercised with more data.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/5627",
