  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nFor the PromQL language server, it is crucial to be able to map string positions to AST Nodes in PromQL queries.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nI'd like to add the following function to the `promql.Node` interface:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPositionRange() PositionRange\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype PositionRange struct {\r\n    Start int\r\n    End int\r\n}\r\n```\r\ncontains the Position of the corresponding AST Node as a byte offset in the input string.\r\n\r\nThe necessary metadata will be stored in the AST Nodes.\r\n\r\nThis would essentially be a more lightweight and less complex version of #6061.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWould people be ok if I go ahead with these changes as described?\r\n\r\ncc @brian-brazil @juliusv @simonpasquier \r\n\r\n",
