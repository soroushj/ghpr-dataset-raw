(for example this can happen in a CI environment where for short periods of time nothing is ingested)\r\n\r\n** Possible solution: **\r\nUse `scrape_series_added`, but it's not the right metric in my humble opinion. We should have a metric like `scrape_targets` (could not find it, maybe it exists but I just missed it?) to be able to correlate on that, to get the correct result - which would be that Prometheus is not ingesting samples when it should be.",
