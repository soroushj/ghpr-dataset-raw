  "body": "The fingerprint mappings write out a checkpoint at each mapping, syncing it to disk (https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/e83f05fe93c32c9e808b2a6a907337b442a540dc/storage/local/persistence.go#L1352). This is O(n^2).\n\nThis is done while the raw fingerprint is locked (https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/e83f05fe93c32c9e808b2a6a907337b442a540dc/storage/local/storage.go#L589), so a scrape of an existing timeseries which is now colliding is now blocked waiting for the checkpoint to be written. Each sample from a scrape is processed sequentially, so this can block many scrapes.\n\nIf you've many new collisions, this can block scraping for quite a while. The example I'm looking at seems to have tens of thousands of collisions which took an hour to work through before scraping worked again.\n\nI recommend switching to appending new mappings rather than writing out a whole new file. We should also look at coalescing the write() and syncs() together, otherwise we'll be bottlenecked there too.\n",
