  "body": "Prometheus includes `-test...` flags in the output of `./prometheus -h`. This is because this PR is pulling in package `testing` into the main binary via `bench.go`: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/1485. That shouldn't happen.\n\nI'm going to move the benchmarking-related code purely into `*_test.go` since it's only used from there and it's also not clear whether we should be making it part of the general package yet (like `Test`).\n\nHowever, while doing that, I also noticed that the Holt Winters benchmarks actually fail, but that the error return value is ignored (https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/promql/bench.go#L42) :( I guess that's one way of tuning benchmarks :) I'll remark that on https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/1485 to see how to proceed.\n",
