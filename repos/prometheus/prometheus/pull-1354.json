  "body": "This gives up on the idea to communicate throuh the Append() call (by\neither not returning as it is now or returning an error as\nsuggested/explored elsewhere). Here I have added a Throttled() call,\nwhich has the advantage that it can be called before a whole _batch_\nof Append()'s. Scrapes will happen completely or not at all. Same for\nrule group evaluations. That's a highly desired behavior (as discussed\nelsewhere). The code is even simpler now as the whole ingestion buffer\ncould be removed.\n\nLogging of throttled mode has been streamlined and will create at most\none message per minute.\n\nFixes #1319 .\n\n@fabxc This is a sneak preview. Still needs to be benchmarked.\n",
