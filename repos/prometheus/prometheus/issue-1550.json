  "body": "Hi Guys,\nI have 2 setups, one on my local development setup (vagrant+vm+docker) and the other aws+docker. In both setups I have prometheus+cAdvisor+Alertmanager running as seperate containers.\nI want to clean the disk storage every 15 minutes so I added below in my prometheus dockerfile-\n`CMD \"-storage.local.retention=15m\"`\nIt seems like after 15 mins my prometheus container dies.\nMy aim is to clean the collected metrics+storage every 15 minutes and only persist and collected metrics from a timestamp if/when an error occurs.\n\nAny idea what might be doing wrong with storage.local.retention?\n",
