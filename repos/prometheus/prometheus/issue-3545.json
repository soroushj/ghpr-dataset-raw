  "body": "I was using Prometheus 1.8 with EC2 discovery, and I gave Prometheus the AWS access key using environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY), as documented [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<ec2_sd_config>) - everything worked fine.\r\n\r\nWhen I moved to Prometheus 2.0, this stopped working and I found out Prometheus ignores the environment variables and tries to use the EC2 instance role. since I my EC2 instance role did not have the required permissions, it failed. \r\n\r\nIs this the expected behavior? If it is, I think it should be documented in the migration guide. ",
