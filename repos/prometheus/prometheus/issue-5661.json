  "body": "**Use case. Why is this important?**\r\n\r\nI've been working on adding the Warnings responses to the go client, in doing so I have noticed that the `LabelValues` and `LabelNames` API calls do not return warnings -- but seem like they should. The `Warnings` are currently returning any time there is an error doing some remote read (and presumably for other non-fatal errors)-- which IMO means that this field should exist for *any* API call that requires coordinating with remote read endpoints -- and `LabelValues` and `LabelNames` both do.",
