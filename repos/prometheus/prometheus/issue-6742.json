  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently the `promql` package includes both the PromQL parser and the PromQL engine.\r\n\r\nThe PromQL language server imports this package, but actually only needs the parser part.\r\n\r\nImporting the full PromQL package, brings a several disadvantages, compared to only importing the parser:\r\n\r\n* A lot of unnecessary dependencies are included. This makes the language server binary almost three times larger, than it would be when only importing the parser part.\r\n* The engine transitively depends on several operating system specifics, such as mmap or unix system calls. This makes it impossible to compile the language server for certain platforms, like Web Assembly.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to create a new `parser` subpackage in the `promql` package that only includes the parser.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @brian-brazil @juliusv @roidelapluie ",
