  "body": "## Proposal\r\n**Use case. Why is this important?**\r\n\r\nPods that are created by Kubernetes Job objects will go to `Completed` state if they finish without error.\r\nWithout a way to stop scraping, the Prometheus `up` state goes to 0 and (in my current environment) this triggers an alert.\r\n\r\nThe Kubernetes SD inserts various labels such as `__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation...` which allow relabel config to drop some targets.  I would like to extend this to a meta label which would hold the `Completed` status, so I can drop those pods from the targets.",
