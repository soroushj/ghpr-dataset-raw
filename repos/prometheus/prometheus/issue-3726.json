  "body": "**What did you do?**\r\nI've tried to use the Kubernetes SD and relabling to only scrape master nodes. In Kubernetes, master nodes are tagged with the label: `node-role.kubernetes.io/master: \"\"` which becomes `__meta_kubernetes_node_label_node_role_kubernetes_io_master=\"\"` in Prometheus after sanitizing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this doesn't seem to be possible with relabling because it's not possible to differentiate between a nonexisting and empty label. This for example will always match, since if the key doesn't exist the regexp gets matched against \"\".\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version: 2.1",
