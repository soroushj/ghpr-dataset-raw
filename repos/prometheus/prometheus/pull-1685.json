  "body": "Since rule evaluations work via String(), this fixes evaluation of\nrules containing GROUP_x modifiers without labels. This change is the\nminimal bugfix (so that we can release a fixed version without\nrisk). It does not intend to implement any additional features (like\nallowing `GROUP_LEFT()` or `ON()` or even `ON` - see discussion in\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1597 ).\n\n@fabxc @brian-brazil \n\nThis will be merged into the release-0.19 branch because we have to release it as 0.19.2 ASAP.\nIt fixes #1676 , which breaks rule evaluation in subtle ways, e.g. alerts will cease to fire and only the logs will tell you so.\n",
