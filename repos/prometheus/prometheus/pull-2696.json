  "body": "For compatibility with other languages.  Fixes #2692.\r\n\r\nIt turns out snappy framing is not part of the standard, so the use of `snappy.New{Reader,Writer}` makes Prometheus remote storage APIs hard to consume in other languages.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n- Makes Prometheus use `snappy.{Encode,Decode}`, which should work across languages (confirmed here: https://github.com/weaveworks-experiments/prometheus-benchmarks/tree/master/cmd/snappy). \r\n- Bumps the `X-Prometheus-Remote-{Read,Write}-Version` headers from `0.0.1` to `0.1.0`, to allow existing implementations to detect the change (*cough* Cortex *cough*)\r\n- Update the example remote storage adapter so it can accept both encodings and return the correctly encoded response to older Prometheus'.\r\n- Makes the remote storage adapter return the `Content-Encoding: snappy` header for read responses.\r\n\r\nI haven't made the response side of read requests backwards compatible in the Prometheus code - I reasoned that people running bleeding edge Prometheus can probably run bleeding edge storage adapter.  This means new Prometheus will fail to talk to old storage adapter for reads, buts thats the case anyway, as they won't understand the raw snappy encoding.",
