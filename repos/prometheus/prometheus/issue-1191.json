  "body": "I am trying to access Prometheus via the Kubernetes reverse proxy (`kubectl proxy`). The resulting URL is `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/prod/services/prometheus/graph` which gets proxied to the path `/graph` on the Prometheus server. Problem is that the JS can not load its resources, since it tries to use  `http://localhost:8001/static/js/` instead of  `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/prod/services/prometheus/static/js/`.\n\nI found the `-web.external-url` flag, but it does not solve my problem. If I do `-web.external-url=/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/prod/services/prometheus/` then `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/prod/services/prometheus/graph` does not work any more, because it would need to be `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/prod/services/prometheus/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/prod/services/prometheus/graph`. So I can't solve the issue with the flag because it expects that the reverse proxy does not change the path, which the Kubernetes proxy does.\n",
