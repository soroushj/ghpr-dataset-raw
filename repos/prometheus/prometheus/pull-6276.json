It ports the existing page without any UI design changes. \r\n\r\nIt also extends the `/api/v1/targets` api by adding two fields:\r\n  + `scrapePool` - the name of the pool (e.g, `\"blackbox\"`) grouping several targets together\r\n  + `lastScrapeDuration` - the duration in nanoseconds of the last scrape\r\nand by adding a query parameter:\r\n\r\nIt also adds a query parameter to the targets endpoint:\r\n  + `state` - `active` or `dropped` (or `any`), which limits the api response payload to `activeTargets` or `droppedTargets`, respectively. The default behavior is still to return both. This will go a long way in improving render time of the page, which does not require `droppedTargets` at this point.\r\n\r\nFixes #6269",
