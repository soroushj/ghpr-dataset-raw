  "body": "There may be cases where users have multiple different scrape configs that share a SD configuration, but where other settings such as relabelling are different.\r\n\r\nWe have been slowly adding the ability to filter down at the SD level in an ad-hoc way for each SD, but given the number of things that a Prometheus is likely monitoring I think there's another potential approach to keeping load on the SD sane.\r\n\r\nIf there's two identical SD configs, let's only instantiate it once and then feed it into each required scrape config. This means a naieve config will have constant load on SD relative to the number of scrape configs, and avoid a good chunk of users having to worry about SD performance.",
