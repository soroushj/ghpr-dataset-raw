  "body": "In docker 1.12, the docker engine will ship with swarm mode built in. This means that it is now possible to stand up a swarm cluster using a bunch of nodes with just docker installed. In addition, swarm mode will come with dns and health checks built-in, negating the need to run consul or some other service discovery mechanism. More info here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/\n\nIt would be nice if prometheus can directly use the new services API to discover services running in a swarm cluster: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#3-8-services\n\nPerhaps the config option could be called `docker_swarm_sd`.\n",
