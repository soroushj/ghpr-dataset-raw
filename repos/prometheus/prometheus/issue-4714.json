  "body": "@fabxc 's email address (fabian.reinartz@coreos.com) seems outdated.\r\n\r\nBeyond that formally required update, does the current state of MAINTAINERS.md still represent reality?\r\n\r\nLocal storage is still just missing here (which is worse in combination with https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb/issues/403 ).\r\n\r\nDo the other focus areas still make sense? Both their layout as well as the maintainers assigned.\r\n\r\nAs an example, SD was seriously broken for a long time (rendering 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 useless in larger production scenarios). My vague memory tells me that things got rectified mostly by @krasi-georgiev with no noticeable shepherding or mentoring by the maintainers.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are rather trivial formalities like #3399 that might still have nasty consequences, given the visibility and importance of this project. It would be great if somebody felt responsible for those.",
