  "body": "Crash recovery deals properly with inconsistent data in the leveldb directories  archived_fingerprint_to_timerange and archived_fingerprint_to_metric. However, in rare cases, the leveldb can be corrupted in a way that already opening it fails.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the whole crash recovery bails out.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should nuke the respective LevelDBs and continue recovery as far as possible. In fact, nuking archived_fingerprint_to_timerange can be completely recovered (it just will take a long time because all archived time series have to be unarchived, note that this will require additional RAM and has to be taken into account for #2139). Nuking archived_fingerprint_to_metric will mean the loss of all archived series, but that's still better than losing everything.",
