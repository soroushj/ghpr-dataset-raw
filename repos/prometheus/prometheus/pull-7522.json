  "body": "Sadly, just linking to the Histogram best practice document, as done\r\nfor `histogram_quantile`, would be confusing here because the best\r\npractice document only deals with quantiles in the context of\r\nHistograms and Summaries, but that has nothing to do with the\r\n`quantile` aggregator and `quantile_over_time` function, which is\r\nalready a source of a lot of confusion.\r\n\r\nThus, I think the least bad solution is to add a short explanation in\r\nparentheses directly here. There isn't even a good resource on the\r\ninternet we can link to. A lot of statisticians use \u03c6-quantiles, but\r\nthey don't have a generally accepted name for it.\r\n\r\nConveniently, the `quantile` aggregator is already at the end of the\r\nlist, so the explanation in parentheses doesn't destroy the flow too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nA footnote would be a ideal, but I don't know if/how we would do this\r\nin Nanoc.\r\n\r\nFixes #3791 .",
