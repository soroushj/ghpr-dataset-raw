  "body": "The queue time for a query is calculated and included in the total query time in query_stats, but there is no `slice=\"queue_time\"` label in the `query_duration_seconds` metric where everything else from query_stats is exposed.\r\n\r\nI looked at `promql/engine.go` history but couldn't see anywhere it was explicitly removed, so I can only figure it was an oversight.\r\n\r\nIn any case it was trivial to add, so I'll have a PR for it shortly.",
