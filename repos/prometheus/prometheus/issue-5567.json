Optional and defaults to maximum possible time.\r\n```\r\nIn my case I have specified timestamp of 2019-05-13 17:00 as 1557756000000, but apparently **it needs to be without last 3 digits** (**so in seconds**, not in milliseconds).\r\n\r\nIn result my data was totally wiped out using this query:\r\n```\r\n/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?end=1557756000000&match[]=up{job=\"test\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Suggestion:**\r\n1. modify documentation and add that unix timestamp must be in form of seconds;\r\n2. add check in prometheus to validate unix timestamp (by length, for example), return \"not accepted\" if unix timestamp was in incorrect form.",
