  "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\n**Original proposal idea:** ~Add ability to set a limit of total series/samples per scrape config. This would override any sample_limit set per scrape config target and set the limit of series instead proportional for each scrape target. This would be an optional field, so would be compatible with any current configuration. (Also exposing this value as a metric to potentially alert on this with the scrape_samples_scraped metric, might be a good idea.).~\r\n\r\n**New proposal idea:** Add ability to set a limit of the number of targets per scrape config. This would work together with the `sample_limit` per scrape config target and would provide a way to capacity plan better.\r\n\r\nFeedback or alternative ideas welcome! :) \r\n\r\n**Use case. Why is this important?**\r\nDue to the dynamic nature of service discovery, it\u2019s practically impossible to do accurate capacity planning, having an overall limit regardless of the number of scrape targets would be very helpful from an admin perceptive to prevent any accidental bad actor by limiting the number of ingested series.",
