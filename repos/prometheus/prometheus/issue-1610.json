  "body": "I have just run into an issue where targets disappear from the DNS SRV record but stick around in Prometheus. The new targets have been added, but the old ones don't disappear. I couldn't detect any hung goroutine are something, but perhaps I didn't look carefully enough.\n\nI have the full goroutine dump if needed.\n\nI'll report here if I see the issue happening more often. (So far this was the only incident.)\n\nThis has happened with the stock 0.18.0 binary.\n\n@fabxc Perhaps this is related to the occasional K8s SD hiccups reported elsewhere, i.e. something in the retrieval layer might get stuck that is not specific to K8s.\n",
