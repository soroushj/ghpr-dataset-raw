  "body": "Signed-off-by: Kemal Akkoyun <kakkoyun@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/7198, this PR attempts to fix https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/6878, using deferred SeriesSet iterator.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Prometheus executes PromQL \u201c.Select\u201d queries sequentially. Particularly for the remote storages, this implementation wastes CPU cycles while waiting for independent queries.\r\n\r\nRequirements that gathered from the comments of https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/6878 and https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/6887.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n* Should NOT use all the available CPU.\r\n  * Limit concurrency\r\n* PromQL should not care about how the querier is implemented, it should always be the same logic.\r\n* Should avoid introducing changes to LOCAL storage.\r\n* Should avoid spawning goroutines if there is just a single selector.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\nThis PR fulfils the requirements listed above by introducing changes to `storage.SeriesSet`, `storage.Querier`, `promql/engine` and `storage/remote`.\r\n* Add `Warnings()` to `storage.SeriesSet` https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/commit/18dddfb771f0a8711e9158dc624bd8d18beaf544\r\n* Only return `storage.SeriesSet` from `storage.Querier.Select()` https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/commit/354a74630056f5b58251376eb96888cc22f1d1c5\r\n* Modify `promql/engine` to propogate errors at evaluation stage. https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/commit/72203b0f7b29bb83fa5716ae026cd576428039da\r\n* And adds async implementation of SeriesSet to remote reads https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/commit/1c28c9fb31ee4dee5c4a54f204436c9d2c1e815e\r\n\r\nThis PR could be separated into smaller PRs if needed.\r\n\r\n#### TODO\r\n* [ ] Benchmarks",
