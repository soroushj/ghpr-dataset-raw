  "body": "Since every scraper has a rather large cache now for all staleness handling and usage of `AddFast` a reload causes severe memory spikes of up to 2x.\r\n\r\nOn reload we terminate all scrapers as the configuration might have changed. In 2.0, each scraper carries a rather large cache around for staleness handling and usage of `AddFast`. Those caches are dropped and get re-created for all the \"new\" targets. The same happens with the known buffer sizes for each scraper.\r\n\r\nWe could investigate not purging all scrapers and instead try to hot-reload them as well where necessary. This needs some very careful consideration though.\r\n\r\n@brian-brazil ",
