If you see the fix, previously we were adding postings first and symbols later separately in the head, so there is a race here where we capture the new series in compaction and get the old symbols. In this fix, we just add the postings in the head only after capturing the symbols.\r\n\r\nI have added the test to re-produce this and the unknown symbol error disappeared after this fix.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this test reproduces another bug which we have seen before - `unexpected error: persist head block: write compaction: add series: out-of-order series added with label set \"{n414=\\\"v414\\\"}\"` - which this PR does not fix and it leads to a flaky test. So, either I will fix it in the same PR if I find it, or remove the test and add it back when I have a fix for that.",
