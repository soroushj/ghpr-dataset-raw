  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI need to debug intermediate scrape failures and realize there is no way to differentiate between various reasons for a scrape failure after the fact. I can make an educated guess whether a scrape timed out or failed otherwise by using `scrape_duration_seconds` but I can't differentiate between DNS issues, connection refused, resetted connections, EOF and so on.\r\n\r\nTherefor I propose we log scrape failures. I'd propose at info level severity. I consider a scrape failure important enough to not have to enable debug logging, especially given that info is already quite talky with the maintenance sweep messages.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, which would work for me as much, we could try to come up with a timeseries or additional labels for `up`, but I think people would prefer logging.",
