  "body": "The storage requires that samples are sorted by timestamp, i.e. a timestamp that is saved to the storage layer must have a timestamp at least as high as the previous sample. This constraint is just by contract so far. It is not checked or enforced.\n\nUnfortunately, that's not trivial as a time series might already be archived when a sample for it comes in again. It's pretty expensive to unarchive a series just to check the latest timestamp.\n\nIdeas:\n- Never accept timestamps from the future (+/- a certain tolerated skew).\n- Then the mtime of a time series file is an upper bound for the last timestamp.\n- Save the last timestamp in the series object.\n",
