It attempted to update the typeahead metric source without the typeahead having been initialized. \r\n\r\n2) The second one adds a step to update the URL when queries were submitted by pressing enter. \r\n\r\nI've tested this in various ways and as far as I can tell this issue is fixed. Please try it out and let me know what kinds of things you run into! ",
