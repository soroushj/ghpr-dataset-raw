  "body": "Whenever a route prefix is applied, the router prepends the prefix to\r\nthe URL path on the request. For most handlers, this is not an issue\r\nbecause the request's path is only used for routing and is not actually\r\nneeded by the handler itself. However, Prometheus delegates the handling\r\nof the `/debug/*` endpoints to the `http.DefaultServeMux` which has it's own\r\nrouting logic that depends on the url.Path. As a result, whenever a\r\nprefix is applied, the prefixed URL is passed to the `DefaultServeMux`\r\nwhich has no awareness of the prefix and returns a 404.\r\n\r\nThe issue could be fixed either by manually attaching the pprof\r\nendpoints to the router (basically duplicating pprof.Init) or by\r\ncreating a new handler to construct the proper non-prefixed path to be\r\npassed to `http.DefaultServeMux`. This change implements the latter to\r\navoid having to maintain a list of pprof endpoints.\r\n\r\nFixes #2183.",
