  "body": "**What did you do?**\nI ran Prometheus out of disk space\n\n**What did you expect to see?**\nAn increment in `prometheus_local_storage_series_ops_errors_total` on the `/metrics` of the struggling prometheus. Alternatively, an equivalent change in the metrics which I could use to drive an alert when this happens again.\n\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\nNo clear signal appeared in the metrics. Instead, the problem was discovered when RPCs to alertmanager failed often enough that I read the stderr log of the failing prometheus and saw all the \"Error while checkpointing[...] no space left on device\" logs created by `MemorySeriesStorage.loop`.\n- Prometheus version: \n  \n  1.1.3 (plus some local mods which aren't related)\n- Logs:\n\n```\ntime=\"2016-10-17T13:49:43-04:00\" level=error msg=\"Error while checkpointing: write /var/opt/prometheus/state/heads.db.tmp: no space left on device\" source=\"storage.go:1158\"\ntime=\"2016-10-17T13:49:43-04:00\" level=info msg=\"Checkpointing in-memory metrics and chunks...\" source=\"persistence.go:548\"\n```\n",
