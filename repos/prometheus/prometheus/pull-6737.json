The HTML `id` elements for the discovered label `Tooltip`s could contain characters that would make the `id` and invalid css selector. As a result, when the Reactstrap `Tooltip` code called `querySelectorAll` on the `id`, an error was thrown.\r\n\r\nFor for information, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37270787/uncaught-syntaxerror-failed-to-execute-queryselector-on-document\r\n\r\nThe result was to escape the scrape pool name in the html ID. I used a [polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css.escape) to import `CSS.escape` into [browsers that don't natively support it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS/escape).\r\n\r\nI modified a react page-level integration test to use the job name of `prometheus/test` reported in the bug. This reproduced the issue. Escaping the characters fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nFixes #6732\r\n",
