  "body": "#So here I am, migrating a recording rule from Prometheus 1 to an instance running 2.0.0-rc0:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbanana{color=\"yellow\"} = strawberry{flavor=\"sweet\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrometheus 2 uses YAML. Let's try this?\r\n\r\n```\r\n- record: banana{color=\"yellow\"}\r\n  expr: strawberry{flavor=\"sweet\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInteresting: Prometheus starts properly and the rule gets displayed on the rules page. Yet, I can't seem to get any results when using simple queries like `banana`. Well, as it turns out, the recording rule above introduces an actual metric with name `banana{color=\"yellow\"}`; not `banana`. You end up with metrics along this shape: `banana{color=\"yellow\"}{flavor=\"sweet\"}`. The only way you can access them is if you use queries like `{__name__=~\"banana.*\"}`.\r\n\r\nReading some more documentation, it looks like I need to do this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- record: banana\r\n  expr: strawberry{flavor=\"sweet\"}\r\n  labels:\r\n    color: yellow\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuestion: would it make sense to add some kind of safety belt to the recording rules parser to reject names that don't match `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`?",
