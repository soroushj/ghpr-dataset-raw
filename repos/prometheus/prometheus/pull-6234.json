They use `jest` (via `react-scripts`) with `enzyme`. There are also a few things it cleans up.\r\n\r\nResolves #6166 (at least in part). In the future, more tests can be added, especially for callbacks.\r\nIt would also be nice to have integration and/or e2e tests, but this seemed like a good place to start.",
