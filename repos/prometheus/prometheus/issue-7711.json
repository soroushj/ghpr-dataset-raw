  "body": "**What did you do?**\r\n\r\nI used PromConsole.Graph with `renderer: \"area\"`, and often see time series elevated more than they should be, as if they were stacked on other time series which are not actually under them.  I attach a screenshot.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/livebungalow/promconsole-rendering-example for a small working example (well, non-working, which is the point).  For the purposes of that example, I monkey-patch `PromConsole.Graph.prototype.buildQueryUrl` to inject data which provokes the issue -- I copied this data from an actual `query_range` response, formatted it, and reduced it to a manageable size.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nTime series resting on the x-axis.\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\n\r\nTime series elevated off the x-axis.  The linked example repo has sample data that provokes the problem.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\nThe linked example uses the docker image `prom/prometheus:v2.19.3` with its standard configuration file.",
