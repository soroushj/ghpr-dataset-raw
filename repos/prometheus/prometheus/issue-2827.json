We have small blips in the data which are normal, but which you can't see unless you bump the resolution to something like 60s. However in doing this Chrome crashes outright, and firefox complains about a script dying.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nFiner data in the graph\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\n\r\nHe's dead, jim\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/\r\n\r\n1.7 tag\r\n\r\n* System information:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLinux 4.4.35+ x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version: \r\n```\r\nprometheus -version\r\nprometheus, version 1.7.0 (branch: master, revision: bfa37c8ee39d11078662dce16c162a61dccf616c)\r\n  build user:       root@7a6329cc02bb\r\n  build date:       20170607-09:43:48\r\n  go version:       go1.8.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome information not included as I don't think it's relevant.
