  "body": "It seems like console templates in Prometheus 16.2 are not working in Firefox 44 due to a date parsing issue:\n\nA console template (when clicking on the rewind butten) runs the following code:\n\n```\nPromConsole.TimeControl.prototype.getEndDate = function() {\n  if (this.endElement.value === '') {\n    return null;\n  }\n  return new Date(this.endElement.value).getTime();\n};\n```\n\nThe property `this.endElement.value` is set to a value such as `2016-3-1 17:55`. It seems like Firefox is unable to create a valid Date from this and returns `None` from the `getEndDate` function. This breaks the template rendering.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Open http://demo.robustperception.io:9090/consoles/node-overview.html?instance=demo.robustperception.io%3a9100 in Firefox\n- Click the rewind button\n- The URL will append the invalid paramters `#pctc{%22duration%22%3A3600%2C%22endTime%22%3Anull}` to the URL. \n- Not timeseries are shown.\n",
