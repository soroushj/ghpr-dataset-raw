Why is this important?**\r\nGrouping of exporters when using consul is broken for job rename.\r\n\r\n## Bug Report\r\n**What did you do?**\r\nUpgraded to latest 2.5 version. All exporters discovered with consul ended up with a single job name instead of rename for each exporter which was working flawlessly with 1.8.0\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nContinued renaming of job name, so all discovered exporters are sorted correctly in the prometheus view. Downgrading to 2.4.3 resolved the issue.\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version:\r\n\r\n2.5.0",
