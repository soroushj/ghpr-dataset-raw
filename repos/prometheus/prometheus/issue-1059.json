However, in the following, the series file write may fail (in case of a rewrite it will be all or nothing, in case of appending it might even partially fail), in which case the persist watermark needed to be adjusted (or better set to the appropriate value after successful write of the new series file).\n\nAlso, consider how to recover from a partial append.\n",
