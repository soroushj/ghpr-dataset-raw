Under which circumstances?**\r\nThe query runs until it exhausts all available memory on the host and OOM killer get is. I have set it up in a repro env locally and the query has been running for ~60m (its still going) even though I have the timeout set to the default 2m.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version:\r\n\r\n2.2",
