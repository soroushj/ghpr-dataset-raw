  "body": "[NOTICE]: <> (If your question is around usage and not a bug in Prometheus please use: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-users)\r\n\r\n**What did you do?**\r\nI'm scraping NetData targets that give the timestamp with the metric in the response as seen below. Sometimes some metrics are not often updated (or ever after they're created) leading to out of bounds errors. \r\n\r\nHere's an example, I've added the comment to the out of bounds metric for the purpose of this ticket.\r\n```\r\napps_vmem_tc_qos_helper{instance=\"host\"} 402 1499115245472\r\napps_vmem_email{instance=\"host\"} 0 1498781084668                 # this metric is out of bounds\r\napps_vmem_logs{instance=\"host\"} 111669 1499115245472\r\napps_vmem_ssh{instance=\"host} 10027 1499115245472\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy settings for block durations seem to be very reasonable.\r\nstorage.tsdb.max-block-duration \t17h48m0s\r\nstorage.tsdb.min-block-duration \t2h0m0s\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nI would expect that only the time series' that are out of bounds be dropped, not the target entirely. Logs only indicate this is a warning.  I assume the expected behaviour is to drop **only** the erroneous time series' during ingestion and append the rest that are correctly within the bounds.  \r\n\r\nSo for example if a target has 3 metrics which are out of bounds, I should ingest all except those three. \r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\nAll time series' from a target with _any_ metrics that are 'out of bounds' are being dropped. So even if 1 out of 1,000 is out of bounds, **all** 1,000 get dropped and the target is considered 'down' due to the out of bounds errors. \r\n\r\n* Prometheus version: \r\nI'm a little bit ahead of the 2.0.0-alpha.2 release but behind the current branch. \r\n```\r\nprometheus, version 2.0.0-alpha.2a (branch: dev-2.0, revision: dfef6cf2345465285e27802fcd24219ccbab1523)\r\n  build user:       jeff@localhost.localdomain\r\n  build date:       20170616-16:54:53\r\n  go version:       go1.8\r\n```\r\n**Logs**\r\nJul 03 21:15:21 ip prometheus[1829]: time=\"2017-07-03T21:15:21Z\" level=warning msg=\"append failed\" err=\"out of bounds\" source=\"scrape.go:606\" target=....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
