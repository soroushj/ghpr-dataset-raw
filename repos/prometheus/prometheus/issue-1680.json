A Private (Management IP) and a Public (Floating) IP.\nwith 0.19.1; Prometheus is only detecting the Private IP; thus it fails it's probe when hitting the Node Port and cAdvisor port.\n\n![screen shot 2016-05-27 at 11 47 20 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/320206/15618031/199916f4-2409-11e6-88b2-4f07e5d41bfe.png)\n\nIf I hit that same path using the Public (FloatingIP) that's tied to that endpoint; the /metrics page pulls up just fine.\n\nSo; is this a Prometheus issue? or a Kubernetes issue?\nI'm going through both repos to see where the problem might be coming from.\nThis worked fine using the 0.19.0 container; started failing with 0.19.1.\n",
