  "body": "A scrape might be incomplete because of a network error (connection closed, time-out, incomplete HTTP content, ...) or because a client wasn't able to collect all metrics (for whatever reason).\n\nWith https://github.com/prometheus/common/issues/14, it will be able to detect incomplete scrapes even without a network error.\n\nAt the very least, an incompletely scraped target must be marked as unhealthy, and its `up` metric must be 0. (This might or might not already be the case for network failures.)\n\nOther measures to deal with incomplete scrapes need vetting:\n\nIt is easiest to reason about metrics if scrapes are atomic, i.e. either ingest all samples from a complete scrape, or none at all. Implementing an atomic scrape semantics has to be done carefully to not introduce a lot of allocation churn or unpredictable memory consumption (due to buffering until completion of a scrape is confirmed) and to not incur a significant performance cost.\n\nOn the other hand, in some situations it might be best to ingest what we can get, even if it is from an incomplete scrape. Via the `up` metric, alerts sensitive to incomplete scrapes can still be protected.\n\nNote that a metric family will always be ingested as a whole from protobuf, even without a termination marker in the exchange format. The same guarantee can be given for the text format once we have a termination marker in the exchange format. However, since appending happens sequentially per time series, a rule evaluation might see some samples from a metric family already ingested but others not - even from a complete scrape. \n",
