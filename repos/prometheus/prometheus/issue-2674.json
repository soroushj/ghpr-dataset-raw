  "body": "I have a bunch of gauges collected via sql_exporter. The metric for a given label set only exists when its value is nonzero (they're mostly row counts; zero rows means no count means no metric).\r\n\r\nThis is what the input data looks like. The red timeseries is either 1 or does not exist here (graphing it alone yields no points where the combined graph shows it as 0):\r\n![raw](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98387/25659105/243e9652-3041-11e7-8f17-1e6e3ff3a00f.png)\r\n\r\nMaking the query `deriv(metric[2m])` yields a hole in the middle:\r\n![deriv](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98387/25659136/5630c37e-3041-11e7-8f28-e44ffd0e7874.png)\r\nPresumably this is some kind of degenerate case where `deriv()` doesn't like the data coming and going.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a big deal in and of itself, but when wrapping the expression in `sum()`, that hole punches a hole in the final sum:\r\n![spectacle f24030](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98387/25659167/841cbcca-3041-11e7-8056-1a5024d389e0.png)\r\n\r\nAnd that is clearly not what I want. `delta()` doesn't have the problem, but does not scale per second. `rate()` works here but is obviously wrong on a gauge when the value goes down. There seems to be no `rate()` equivalent for gauges (`deriv()` is a lot more complex).\r\n\r\n```# prometheus --version\r\nprometheus, version 1.5.2 (branch: , revision: bd1182d)\r\n  build user:       portage@binhost\r\n  build date:       20170329-06:45:32\r\n  go version:       go1.7.5```",
