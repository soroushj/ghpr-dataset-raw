  "body": "Currently you cannot build Prometheus using the zip-files mentioned in fe. https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/0.12.0.\n\nWhen you try you get a bunch of warnings such as `fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /tmp)` eventually followed by the usage output of 6l and the failure `Makefile:30: recipe for target 'build' failed`.\n\nRelevant chat on IRC:\n\n> jrv | ah, the zip file doesn't work because the Makefile expects the source directory to still be a git repository.\n> jrv | GitHub creates those zip files automatically, so we never tried that.\n> jrv | \"-X main.buildRevision\" isn't followed by an argument for that reason, which is why ld6 crashes\n> jrv | cause that's built via a git command\n> jrv | VERSION=$(shell cat `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`/VERSION)\n",
