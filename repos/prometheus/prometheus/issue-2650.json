Under which circumstances?**\r\n\r\nSpinner spins forever, errors in js console\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the new elements display introduced in #2532 doesn't handle failed queries and always tries to extract information provided by `xhr.responseJSON.data.result.length`.\r\n\r\n@Conorbro ",
