  "body": "This PR brings over to master a bunch of work that happened to the remote storage APIs during 1.7/1.8:\r\n- Port codec.go over form 1.8 branch (groundwork for Prom2.0 supporting remote read)\r\n- remote: Expose ClientConfig type (see #3165)\r\n- Port 'Make queue manager configurable.' to 2.0, (see #2991), fixes #3095\r\n- Port Metric name validation to 2.0 (see #2975), fixes #2996\r\n- Port 'Don't disable HTTP keep-alives for remote storage connections.' to 2.0 (see #3173)\r\n- Port remote read server API to 2.0, includes #3263 and #3325\r\n\r\n~I'm still going through the code / PRs to ensure I've got everything, as its not a straight forward port.~\r\n\r\nIncludes a bunch of refactoring so we're not doing two conversions on the read path.  Write path is still suboptimal mind you.\r\n",
