  "body": "Hi,\n\nIn my case i didn't have a valid certificate for my domain so when i try to get metrics with https on my openshift I have : \n\n``` bash\nGet https://10.0.0.254:8443/metrics: x509: cannot validate certificate for 10.0.0.254 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs \n```\n\nIn the kubernetes_sd_configs, we have the insecure flag, but i didn't find in the scrape_config part\nIs it possible to have something like that ?\n\n``` yaml\n  - job_name: 'openshift-metrics'\n    scheme: https\n    insecure: True\n\n    target_groups:\n      - targets: ['10.0.0.254:8443']\n\n    bearer_token: '<token>'\n```\n\nThanks,\n",
