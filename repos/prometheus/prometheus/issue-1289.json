Evaluate `max(expr)`\n\nExpected behavior: the largest scalar.\n\nActual behavior: nondeterminstically, either the largest scalar, or NaN.\n\nFurther notes:\n- `topk(1, expr)` is also nondeterministic\n- `max(sort(expr)` reliably returns NaN\n- `max(sort_desc(expr))` reliably returns the largest scalar (and is the workaround I'm using for now)\n",
