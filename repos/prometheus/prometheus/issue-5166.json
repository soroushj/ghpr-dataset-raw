  "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\nDefault value for `max_samples_per_send` - 100 - is too low for any non-idle Prometheus setup with `remote_write` enabled. It results in too frequent requests to remote storage if Prometheus scrapes more than a few hundred metrics per second. High requests' frequency wastes resources on both Prometheus and remote storage sides, so users have to increase `max_samples_per_send` after the first attempt to write metrics to remote storage.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if default value for `max_samples_per_send` is increased from 100 to 1000 or even 10K. This would simplify `remote_write` configuration for the majority of users.",
