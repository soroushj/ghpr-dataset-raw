  "body": "## `any()` aggregation operator\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if we had an aggregation operator that explicitly states \"i don't care which value you pick, just pick one\". This could have a marginal performance advantage over choosing an arbitrary aggregation, but the real benefit is semantic. when you put, for example, `min()` in a query, the reader assumes that this particular aggregation was chosen for a reason, but in some cases it doesn't matter, like when multiple identical or non-overlapping series are being aggregated. picking an arbitrary aggregation adds meaningless specificity and can make it harder to understand complex queries, while something like `any()` would remove any false meaning from the expression.",
