  "body": "This is inconsistent with float arithmetic in Go. It's not a theoretical-only concern either: I had an alert spuriously fire because the (summary-based) average was too high. You see, sum and count were both zero, so the mean ratio was +Inf which was larger than the threshold; NaN would not have alerted in that case.\n\nWorkaround: AND your alert rules with tests like foo_count != 0.\n",
