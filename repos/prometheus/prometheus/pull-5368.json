  "body": "Fix https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/5193\n\nUsing just name causes the linked issue - if new rules are inserted with\nthe same name (but different labels), the reordering will cause stale\nmarkers to be inserted in the next eval for all shifted rules, despite\nthem not being stale.\n\nIdeally we want to avoid stale markers for time series that still exist\nin the new rules, with name and labels being the unique identifer.\n\nThis change adds labels to the internal map when copying the old rule\ndata to the new rule data. This prevents the problem of staling rules\nthat simply shifted order.\n\nIf labels change, it is a new time series and the old series will stale\nregardless. So it should be safe to always match on name and labels when\ncopying state.\n\nCan you have a look @fabxc?",
