  "body": "**What did you do?**\r\nWell, trying to configure Marathon monitoring in Prometheus. Marathon does not support built in authentication, so obviously someone has to use basic_auth to protect Marathon/Mesos. We did the same. \r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nThere is already a way to support basic auth for other modules, then why shouldn't we implement that for marathon_sd_config? Copy/Past stuff!! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version: \r\n\r\n\tprometheus, version 1.7.1 (branch: master, revision: 3afb3fffa3a29c3de865e1172fb740442e9d0133)\r\n  build user:       root@0aa1b7fc430d\r\n  build date:       20170612-11:44:05\r\n  go version:       go1.8.3\r\n\r\n",
