  "body": "It looks like a critical bug, in the new 0.17.0rc1 pre-release version.\n\nReproduction steps:\n1. Make some alert to fire (Alertmanager gets an alert)\n2. Resolve it so it'll stop firing (Alertmanager alert is cleared)\n3. Make the alert to fire again\n\nExpected result:\nAlert should appear as 'firing' in 'Alerts' page, and sent to Alertmanager.\n\nActual result:\nAlert is not firing in 'Alerts' page ((0 active)), and Alertmanager doesn't get it as well.\n\nAdditional information:\nMy alert:\n\n```\nALERT vehicleServer_response_err\n  IF (sum(rate(server_requests_processing_time_millis_total{status!=\"200\"}[15s])) BY (status)) > 0\n  FOR 40s\n  ANNOTATIONS {\n    description=\"server returns non-200 status code, for more than 40 seconds (status:  {$labels.status}}).\",\n    summary=\"server returned non-200 status code\"\n  }\n```\n\nWhen the alert's rule triggers again from a different status code, the alert does fire though.\n\nCan't see any errors in stdout.\n",
