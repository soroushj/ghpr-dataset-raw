It turns out both are kept up-to-date by the CI system. Additionally due to https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3778#issuecomment-375965987 , one can think that there's actually a difference between both builds after some sleuthing on Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\nCan you decide one of these Docker repos, and list only that one in documentation?",
