This structure is duplicated by [`github.com/prometheus/prometheus/storage/remote.QueueManagerConfig`](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/v2.0.0-beta.2/storage/remote/queue_manager.go#L126) which is not configurable.\r\n\r\nIn #2552 @brian-brazil wrote\r\n> I'd suggest hardcoding to reasonable sane values, and seeing when someone wants it changed what their use case is.\r\n\r\nI want to increase `max_samples_per_send` because 100 samples per insert is too small value for [PromHouse](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/PromHouse) and [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.yandex).\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like to see `QueueManagerConfig` removed \u2013 that's one of the places where Prometheus duplicates the same code in different packages.\r\n\r\nI can work on it if you are ok with it.\r\n\r\n/cc @tomwilkie",
