  "body": "Across the SoundCloud fleet of Prometheus servers, I have seen rare series quarantining because of the dreaded \"dropped more chunks from persistence than from memory\" error. So far, we attributed this error to data corruption (as the most likely scenario is a truncated file, which can plausibly happen in many different error cases). Now I have seen it happen with the same time series on two mirrored servers, which hints towards properties of that time series to be a factor. The time series in question were very sparse, like one data point every couple of hours. This is a rare occurrence in typical Prometheus setups, so a bug caused by that would only be tickled rarely. Since a head chunk is closed if it doesn't get any samples appended for more than 1h, the time series in question would have only chunks with one sample each. This might throw series maintenance off the rails.\r\n\r\n",
