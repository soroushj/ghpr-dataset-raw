  "body": "Current state: k8s SD discovers Services and their Endpoints; and Nodes.\n\nMy problem: I need to scrape metrics from Pods that are _not_ ready. k8s does not put non-ready pods into a service, so prom's k8s SD module will never discover them.\n\nSolution: Add pods to k8s sd.\n\nOne possibly issue is that prometheus would only be able to communicate directly with pods if it is within the cluster. That's how it is in my case, but this limitation might need to be surfaced somewhere/somehow. However, if prom is in cluster, then it can talk to individual pods using the pod's IP.\n\np.s., I chatted about this via IRC and was asked to tag @jimmidyson on this issue.\n",
