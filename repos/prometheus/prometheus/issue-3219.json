We were initially going to see if people really need another format and slowly add it back I guess\r\n11:11 G<gouthamve[m]> Can you create an issue?\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was using `--log.format=\"logger:syslog?appname=prometheus&local=7&json=true\"`. If there's another way to do that in 2.0 that'll be preferred I'm happy to change. I suppose it could also be done with process supervisors or something. However, I would expect people upgrading from 1.x will be used to this flag/format and will have something that works for them.",
