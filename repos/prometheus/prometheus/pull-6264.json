  "body": "The challenge was that the path prefix can be set dynamically as a flag\r\non Prometheus, but the React app bundle is statically compiled in to\r\nexpect a given path prefix. By adding a placeholder value to the React\r\napp's index.html and replacing it in Prometheus with the right path\r\nprefix during serving, this injects Prometheus's path prefix into the\r\nReact app via a global const.\r\n\r\nThreading the path prefix into the different React components could have\r\nbeen done with React's Contexts (https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html),\r\nbut I found the consumer side of context values to be a bit cumbersome\r\n(wrapping entire components in context consumers), so I ended up\r\npreferring direct threading of the path prefix values to components that\r\nneeded them. Also, using contexts in tests is more verbose than just\r\npassing in path prefix values directly.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/6163\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Julius Volz <julius.volz@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Don't forget!\r\n    \r\n    - If the PR adds or changes a behaviour or fixes a bug of an exported API it would need a unit/e2e test.\r\n    \r\n    - Where possible use only exported APIs for tests to simplify the review and make it as close as possible to an actual library usage.\r\n    \r\n    - No tests are needed for internal implementation changes.\r\n    \r\n    - Performance improvements would need a benchmark test to prove it.\r\n    \r\n    - All exposed objects should have a comment.\r\n    \r\n    - All comments should start with a capital letter and end with a full stop.\r\n -->",
