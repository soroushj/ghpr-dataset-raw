  "body": "**What did you do?**\r\nI have a cluster which returns ~150k names from `/api/v1/label/__name__/values`. This takes a decent amount of time for the browser to load, but then when you go to type it is slow to the point of unusable. For me at least (in both chrome and firefox) after I finish typing 2 characters it immediately pegs a CPU core for ~2m or so, rending the browser useless.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nI expect it to keep up :) A great example is from the grafana guys. They recently added ace editor support for promql (https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/9118) and that javascript typeahead doesn't have problems with my 150k names",
