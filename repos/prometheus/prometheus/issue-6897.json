  "body": "**What did you do?**\r\n1. Run histogram quantile on any distribution where the the total count of observations across all buckets is 0.\r\n2. This came up for me in a use case where I am doing quantile on a bucketed throughput metric and throughput can die off for an interval. In my particular use case I'm looking at signed estimate error for an estimation system using a histogram where the le tags have a large negative to positive range (for underestimating -> overestimating).\r\n3. Results in specifying the lowest negative bucket as the value of all quantile inputs for the interval with no observations.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nOpen question - I think I would expect NaN if there are no samples to interpolate against in any buckets. I could be convinced 0 but without domain knowledge of the histogram this seems off. \r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\nI saw in this case -8192 - my largest negative LE (I believe caused by https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/41151ca8dc069448515f48893b8631b9a3ad8df8/promql/quantile.go#L91)\r\n\r\nThe rank variable is 0 since there are no samples - then the go binary search finds the min bucket.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n* System information:\r\n\r\n\tinsert output of `uname -srm` here\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version:\r\nDon't have access to box - but from UI:\r\n\r\nVersion: 2.7.1\r\nRevision: 62e591f928ddf6b3468308b7ac1de1c63aa7fcf3\r\nBranch: HEAD\r\nBuildDate: 20190131-11:16:59\r\nGoVersion: go1.11.5",
