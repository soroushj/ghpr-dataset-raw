  "body": "**What did you do?**\r\nConfigured Prometheus with remote storage to push data to InfluxDB (purely for long retention purposes)\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\nSome kind of 'intelligent' awareness of where to query data from.\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?**\r\nAll read queries are simply pushed to remote storage\r\n\r\n* Prometheus version:\r\n1.7.1\r\n\r\nIt would seem to me that currently a common setup would be:\r\n[ Prometheus ] -> [ Remote Storage Adapter ] -> [ InfluxDB ]\r\n\r\nWhere InfluxDB or any other solution would purely be used when wanting more data than just Prometheus' retention period.\r\n\r\nA truly intelligent would no doubt be hard to create, but if this setup is indeed common, it could be valuable to introduce a setting to make Prometheus aware of being run in such a setup, allowing queries within Prometheus' retention range to be solely handled by Prometheus.\r\n\r\nA simple workaround (?) would be to have an extra setting in the Remote Storage adapter that returns an empty data set if the query time range is < than $config_file_setting",
