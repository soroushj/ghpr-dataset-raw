  "body": "I come across use cases from time to time where I'd love being able to do some arithmetic in by clauses of aggregations. For example:\n\n```\ncount by (> 64) sum(process_rss_bytes) by (app, proc)) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024)\n```\n\nIn this example (with an exemplary syntax) I want to plot the number of services below and above a certain threshold. It's possible to construct graphs roughly showing the desired data with at least promdash, but it'd be convenient to have first class support for that. For me at least ;), what do people think?\n\n@brian-brazil @beorn7 \n",
