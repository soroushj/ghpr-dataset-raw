  "body": "Considering we're allowed breaking changes to PromQL for 2.0, I'd like us to consider removing the following:\r\n\r\n1) delta. Discussed previously on #1772 with no strong conclusion. I still have yet to see any valid uses cases, and it remains an attractive nuisance with users regularly using it inappropriately.\r\n\r\n2) keep_common. I don't think anyone is really using it, and it has semantic issues as you don't know what labels will come out the other end.\r\n\r\n3) drop_common_labels. This does seem to be used occasionally for display purposes. It has the same semantic issues as keep_common, so I wouldn't mind removing it.\r\n\r\n4) count_scalar. Use cases are better handled by absent() or correct propagation of labels in operations.\r\n\r\nWhat do others think?",
