  "body": "I installed 2.7.0 on a test server and ran into one point of confusion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprometheus, version 2.7.0 (branch: HEAD, revision: 410ee9e04acb8f59f400858752ca82b4ef88035e)\r\n  build user:       root@3bc81b516055\r\n  build date:       20190128-10:09:51\r\n  go version:       go1.11.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe help text for `--storage.tsdb.retention.size` says this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[EXPERIMENTAL] Maximum number of bytes that can be stored for blocks. Units supported: KB, MB, GB, TB, PB. This flag is experimental and can be changed in future releases.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI interpreted that to mean that it followed the common convention of accepting a number as bytes while allowing units as a shortcut for readability. What it actually means is that you must specify one of the units or get an error like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError parsing commandline arguments: units: unknown unit  in 96589578240b\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it either defaulted to bytes or the wording was something like \u201cLimit the maximum size of block storage. Specify the unit suffix using one of: KB, MB, GB, TB, PB.\u201d to make it obvious that it's not optional.",
