  "body": "Fix #7801 . Sort the Select returned series sets for later merge to de-duplicate results. And add test to try to overlap the select returned series sets and make sure it'll return expected results. I tested if I reverted my change (not sort the select results), the test result will fail sometimes due to the duplicated results returned. (About 20%~30% possibility to reproduce it since the result set is still not large enough. But it somehow can protect the behavior since it'll fail sometimes if behavior changed.)\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Luke Chen <showuon@gmail.com>\r\n",
