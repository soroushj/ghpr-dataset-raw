I updated all the image references to use quay.io to keep things consistent. If Docker Hub is preferred, I can change it.\r\n\r\n**Changes**: \r\n- Migrate all Docker image references to use quay.io\r\n- Explain in docs that Docker images are available on both Quay.io and Docker Hub\r\n\r\nSomething that we should do in addition to this PR that I can't change personally is remove the [Dockerfile from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/~/dockerfile/) as mentioned in [this](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3778#issuecomment-375965987) comment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #4665\r\n\r\ncc: @simonpasquier ",
