  "body": "Two cases:\r\n\r\n- An unarchived metric must have at least one chunk desc loaded upon\r\n  unarchival. Otherwise, the file is gone or has size 0, which is an\r\n  inconsistency (because the series is still indexed in the archive\r\n  index). Hence, quarantining is triggered.\r\n\r\n- If loading the chunk descs of a series with a known chunkDescsOffset\r\n  (i.e. != -1), the number of chunks loaded must be equal to\r\n  chunkDescsOffset. If not, there is a data corruption. An error is\r\n  returned, which leads to qurantining.\r\n\r\nIn any case, there is a guard added to not access the 1st element of\r\nan empty chunkDescs slice. (That's what triggered the crashes in #2249.)  A time series with unknown chunkDescsOffset and no chunks in\r\nmemory and no chunks on disk either could trigger that case.\r\nI would assume such a \"null series\" doesn't exist, but it's not\r\nentirely unthinkable to happen (perhaps in future uses of the\r\nstorage). (Create a series, and then something tries to preload chunks\r\nbefore the first sample is added.)\r\n\r\nFixes #2249. \r\n\r\n@brancz perhaps you are getting into storage reviews...\r\n@juliusv is probably the most qualified person (but might be on vacation).\r\n@rtreffer is very interested in this.\r\n\r\nSorry for not adding a specific test case. It needed quite a contraption: Creating a time series that has chunk _descs_ evicted, then corrupt the series file in the right way, and then trigger a query that loads it.",
