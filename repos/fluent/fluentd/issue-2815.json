However, since `rfc5424` is indeed a binary-based protocol, regex is definitely not the way that we should go at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nInstead, we need to find a way to properly implement rfc5424 parsing, probably by integrate with a 3rd party library. However, I can't help with this part in a reasonable short term since I don't know ruby at all.\r\n\r\n",
