  "body": "Fixes #2355 \r\n\r\nThe time format for a plugin logger was out of sync with the parent logger, and the delegation of `#time_format` and `#time_format=` made it impossible to fix the plugin logger's time format without hacks.\r\n\r\nThis problem was not noticeable if the log format was text, because time formatting was delegated via `#caller_line` to the parent logger. However, in the case of JSON output, the plugin logger's `#format_time` method was called, yielding incorrectly-formatted timestamps.\r\n\r\nAdded tests for both text and JSON, and added tests for format changes in general while I was in there.",
