  "body": "On Windows, if using an include directive with spaces in the path, the only way to load the file is to use old DOS short path notation.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- In Windows, create an external config file with any valid configuration in a path similar to \"C:\\Folder With Spaces\\fluentd.conf\"\r\n- In the root config file (e.g. td-agent.conf), add an include directive similar to \"@include C:/Folder With Spaces/fluentd.conf\"\r\n- Start the fluentdwinsvc per normal, and the logs (e.g. td-agent.log) will contain no information\r\n\r\nThe only variant of the above example path that will work is \"C:/FOLDER~1/fluentd.conf\".  \r\n\r\nNote that URI encoding the path (i.e. using %20 for each space) allows fluentd to start correctly, but still does not load the external configuration file. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe include directive should support directories with spaces, or at least document how to escape them, etc.  Additionally, some better logging around this would have been extremely helpful.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n- td-agent v3.4.1\r\n- Windows 2012 R2 (recreated on other Windows too)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNote that I believe I understand the issue by reviewing the eval_include function in lib/fluent/config/v1_parser.rb.  It appears that any path given in the include directive is first passed into URI.parse, which will fail if it has spaces.  If you encode the path, URI.parse will succeed, but then when the path is extracted out of the URI, it will have the form \"/Folder%20With%20Spaces/fluentd.conf\", and that will not work with Dir.glob.  Not sure exactly what fix should be used, but I find it interesting that all paths must go through URI.parse, when file paths would not need to.\r\n",
