Please describe.**\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nCurrent implement,  fluentd just [kills worker](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/02c1e2ba2e46cea5b7b77c5366dfad3a709e9ae2/lib/fluent/supervisor.rb#L178) when receiving SIGHUP(reload signal).\r\nThis needs to re-spawn the worker process. so it takes not a short time (No downtime alright, but fluentd can't deal with messages at that time).\r\n\r\nSo it would be good if there is a more lightweight, safer reload mechanism.\r\nI think switching `Fluent:Engine` to the new one when receiving the signal solves the problem.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI thought that blue-green deployment like reloading would work(starting new config one -> run two processes (old one and new one) at time time -> kill old one).\r\nBut it turned out that this kind of reloading mechanism is not well-matched for fluentd.\r\ne.g. in\\_tail plugin and file\\_buffer plugin don't work properly when running two fluentd processes.\r\n\r\n~~Use [Serverengine](https://github.com/treasure-data/serverengine)'s  [live restart]( https://github.com/treasure-data/serverengine#live-restart) to reload config setting.~~\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",
