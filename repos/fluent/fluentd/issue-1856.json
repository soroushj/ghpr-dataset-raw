  "body": "Fluentd's output plugin somtimes hit un-recoverable error during chunk flush.\r\n\r\n- chunk contains wrong record for output configuration\r\n- output plugin has a bug for specific record\r\n- broken chunk is generated by hardware problem\r\n- wrong setup for destination\r\n\r\nCurrently, we use retry limit and secondary for handling these chunks but it has several problems.\r\n\r\n- bad chunk occupy flush threads until reach retry limit\r\n- non retry limit environment can't rescue bad chunk\r\n\r\nSo we should care bad chunk for stability and performance.\r\nThe idea is if output plugin raises un-recoverable error during chunk flush, such chunks are routed to backup directory.\r\n\r\n- The recoverable errors are TypeError, NoMethodError, ArgumentError, etc\r\n- Use UnrecoverableError for plugin specific error\r\n\r\nIn addition, `<system>` directive provide `backup_dir` parameter. The default is `/tmp/fluentd`.",
