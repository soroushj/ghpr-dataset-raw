  "body": "Fluentd v1 now works on ruby 2.1 or later but it has several drawbacks.\r\n\r\n- ruby 2.1/2.2 are dead version. ruby team doesn't maintain it.\r\n- Need dig_rb gem for `dig` method: See https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/2372\r\n\r\nRemoving 2.1/2.2 is good for the further development. td-agent and docker images use ruby 2.3 or later so it doesn't break popular environment.\r\nHowever removing support without the transition period may break user environment. So support 2.1/2.2 until the end of 2019 is better.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Drop 2.3 together. See https://www.fluentd.org/blog/drop-schedule-announcement-in-2019",
