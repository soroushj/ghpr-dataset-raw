  "body": "\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nWe have a deployment with fluentd client agents forwarding to fluentd aggregators that handle routing and some parsing. The fluentd aggregators are behind an AWS ELB with ASG. So on higher load we spawn automatically new instances. Yet the clients tend to stay on the same instance, so load balancing is far from perfect.\r\n\r\nWe way we use to improve load balance is to use the 'keepalive' tls property present on the 0.12 version\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it seems this property is not present on 1.2.6. Do you have any plans to bring it back?\r\n\r\nDo you propose a different architecture for better load balancing and still have scale up and down feature?\r\n\r\nOS\r\n- Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS\r\n",
