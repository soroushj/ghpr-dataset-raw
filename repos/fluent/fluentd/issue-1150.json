  "body": "Now, Fluentd shows warning if secondary plugin type is different from primary plugin type. But it is nonsense in some cases in Fluentd v0.14. This propose to suppress it if both of primary and secondary use \"standard\" format, instead of implementing `format` method by themselves.\n\nFluentd v0.12 requires buffered output plugins to implement `format` method by themselves. It means that different plugin types have different formatting of buffer chunks.\nSecondary plugin uses buffer chunks formatted by primary plugins. So different plugin types between primary and secondary should causes unexpected errors or failures to operate buffer chunks.\n\nBut Fluentd v0.14 has \"standard\" format, so different plugin types can share the way to format buffer chunks by using standard format.\nThere is no need to warn about type difference between primary and secondary if both these use standard format.\nIt can be implemented by checking plugins implement `format` method by themselves or not.\n",
