  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\nI'm using `exec_filter` to process some data using Python. My initial command looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\n<match logs.**>\r\n    # https://docs.fluentd.org/output/exec_filter\r\n    @type exec_filter\r\n\r\n    command /path/to/python/script\r\n\r\n    <format>\r\n      @type json\r\n    </format>\r\n    <parse>\r\n      @type json\r\n    </parse>\r\n</match>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor logging, my script is using the standard python3 logging library for debugging.\r\nI noticed the script backing up and spent a while trying to debug it, but I now suspect the lower level `child_process_execute` in `fluentd/lib/fluent/plugin_helper/child_process.rb` to be suspect\r\n\r\nUpdating the above command to `command /path/to/python/script 2>> /var/log/td-agent/script.log` seems to suddenly unblock processing\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\nWithin, out_exec_filter, a child process is called via \r\n\r\n```\r\nexecute_child_process = ->(index){\r\n    child_process_execute(\"out_exec_filter_child#{index}\".to_sym, @command, on_exit_callback: exit_callback) do |readio, writeio|\r\n        child_process_callback.call(index, readio, writeio)\r\n    end\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich means the parameter defaults to `stderr: :discard` which then arrives at this block\r\n\r\n```\r\nif !mode.include?(:stderr) && !mode.include?(:read_with_stderr) && stderr != :discard # connect\r\n    writeio, readio, wait_thread = *Open3.popen2(*spawn_args, spawn_opts)\r\nelsif mode.include?(:read_with_stderr)\r\n    writeio, readio, wait_thread = *Open3.popen2e(*spawn_args, spawn_opts)\r\nelse\r\n    writeio, readio, stderrio, wait_thread = *Open3.popen3(*spawn_args, spawn_opts)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I have not debugged any further than this, I would expect if fluentd's plugin is not handling stderr, then it would at least default to sending it to /dev/null or some other place. There was \r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n```\r\nfluentd --version \r\nfluentd 1.7.0\r\npython -m platform\r\nLinux-3.10.0-957.21.3.el7.x86_64-x86_64-with-centos-7.6.1810-Core\r\n```\r\n",
