  "body": "This fixes #1098.\n\n`buf_file` in v0.14 loads all files which matches with glob for buffer file path as queued. That behavior is to read files as much as possible when upgrading Fluentd.\nBut there is a bug to read files as queued, which is written by `out_file` in the same directory with buffer chunk files.\n\nThis change is to fix not to load files which doesn't have a part like `(b|q)[0-9a-f]+`, which shows that file is a buffer chunk.\n#### note about #1098\n#1098 is a result of combination of this bug and `append true`, which does read data from buffer chunk file (this file) and also does write these data to output file (this file) - it is infinite loop of read & write.\n\nThe minimum steps to reproduce it is:\n1. execute command: `echo \"foobar\" > temperature.\\`ruby -e 'puts Time.now.strftime(\"%Y%m%d\")'`.log`\n2. execute fluentd with configuration below:\n3. use ctrl-z to stop Fluentd process without shutdown sequence (shutdown calls flushing)\n\n```\n# no <source> needed\n<match demo.temperature>\n  @type file\n  path temperature\n  flush_interval 1s\n  append true\n</match>\n```\n",
