  "body": "Hi there!\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned [here](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/monitoring-rest-api#datadog-dd-agent-integration), Datadog has a native integration with Fluentd (docs [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/fluentd/)).\r\n\r\nAs part of evolving this integration, we'd like to forward the Fluentd version to Datadog so that users can view this information.\r\n\r\nThe `fluentd` CLI has a `--version` flag (although [not documented](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/command-line-option) in the CLI reference), which is enough for cases when Fluentd is running on the same host than the Datadog Agent.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Fluentd is not available locally, then this method cannot be used.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I'm popping by to discuss exposing the Fluentd version as part of the monitoring API used by Datadog, Prometheus, and probably other systems.\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a `version` key to the `/config.json` endpoint, and by symmetry to the `/config` endpoint.\r\n\r\nFor the JSON endpoint, this would result in:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"pid\": 123,\r\n  \"ppid\": 1,\r\n  \"version\": \"1.8.0.rc2\",\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR shortly with a working implementation.\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI must say I'm not *too* familiar with how Fluentd is used in the wild. So my main question would be: can it actually be the case that a user has Fluentd monitoring enabled on another machine than the one where Fluentd is running?\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/pull/5057",
