  "body": "Add `make nocover` target (that also runs as part of `make cover`) that checks all directories that have Go files but no test files and fails if such directories don't also have `.nocover` marker, which indicates that the directories are silently excluded from code coverage. If `.nocover` marker is found, it is printed, so that it's easy to find directories without code coverage. Directories with `main.go` are ignored.\r\n\r\nThe script found a number of directories:\r\n  * Some of them have only type definitions, so an `empty_test.go` file was added to those\r\n  * Some were legitimately excluded due to external requirements, like the `gocql` module. A `.nocover` file was added to those dirs with an explanation.\r\n  * Four directories were still missing tests, even though it should be possible to add coverage. Those were also marked with `.nocover` file containing the word `FIXME`.\r\n\r\nThe current output of nocover command looks like this:\r\n```\r\n$ make nocover\r\nVerifying that all packages have test files to count in coverage\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./cmd/agent/app/httpserver/thrift-0.9.2\r\n  reason: Thrift-generated files\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./cmd/flags\r\n  reason: FIXME\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./pkg/cassandra/config\r\n  reason: requires connection to Cassandra\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./pkg/cassandra/gocql\r\n  reason: requires connection to Cassandra\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./pkg/cassandra/gocql/testutils\r\n  reason: FIXME\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./pkg/es\r\n  reason: FIXME\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./pkg/es/config\r\n  reason: requires connection to Elasticsearch\r\nPackage excluded from coverage: ./pkg/version\r\n  reason: FIXME\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #168 \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Yuri Shkuro <ys@uber.com>",
