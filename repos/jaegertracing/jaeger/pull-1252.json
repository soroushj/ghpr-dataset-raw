This is problematic when jaeger is imported alongside other projects.\r\n- Because only specific dependencies in `Gopkg.toml` are updated when `dep ensure -update <dependency>` is executed, these pins are unnecessary. Unrelated version bumps cannot happen (as they used to with `glide`)\r\n\r\n## Short description of the changes\r\n- Unpin dependencies\r\n",
