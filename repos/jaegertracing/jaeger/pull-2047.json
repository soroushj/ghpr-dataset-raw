These options needed to be exposed\r\nto the command for performance tuning. The option names matches official Kafka documentation and\r\nnot specific to Samara.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: albert chung <alchung@us.ibm.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe appreciate your contribution to the Jaeger project! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\nBefore creating a pull request, please make sure:\r\n- Your PR is solving one problem\r\n- You have read the guide for contributing\r\n  - See https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n- You signed all your commits (otherwise we won't be able to merge the PR)\r\n  - See https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDELINES.md#certificate-of-origin---sign-your-work\r\n- You added unit tests for the new functionality\r\n- You mention in the PR description which issue it is addressing, e.g. \"Resolves #123\"\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Which problem is this PR solving?\r\n- See #2037\r\n\r\n## Short description of the changes\r\n- Added 2 new command line parameters for Kafka producer\r\n",
