You will likely experience performance issues and false positives if you run this on a large project per commit.\r\n> \r\n> I suggest we integrate Jaeger through Provided Builds, where you deploy our build client (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli) into your CI to report dependencies back to fossa. This model should enable extremely fast and high scale builds/scans from within your CI.\r\n> \r\n> See \u201cfrom a local dev machine\u201d in this article below:\r\n> \r\n> https://docs.fossa.io/docs/importing-a-project",
