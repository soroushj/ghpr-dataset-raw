It's helpful that this store is performant, reliable, has consistent behavior. Scaling and durability are not necessary, of course.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\n\r\nWhen I query:\r\n- with \"Limit Results\" to, say, 10\r\n- the same query with, say, limit 100, would return more than 10 results\r\n- click \"Find Traces\" more than once\r\n\r\n...the results change. Traces appear and disappear from results.\r\n\r\n<!-- required section -->\r\n<!-- If possible, describe the impact of the problem. -->\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nResults should be sorted, then limited. I have a simple PR #1934\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\nNone.",
