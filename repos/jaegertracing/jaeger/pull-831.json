  "body": "Resolves #824\r\n\r\nThis implements option 1 from #824 by removing ParentSpanID from the domain model and only using the References array. `ParentSpanID` is replaced with an accessor `ParentSpanID()` that returns the span ID of the first `child-of` reference for the same trace ID.\r\n\r\nOnce unfortunate discovery: both Cassandra and Elasticsearch models kept the ParentID field in their respective models. It is no longer populated in the domain->db model conversions, but still has to be taken into account in the dbmodel->domain conversion for backwards compatibility with existing data. I don't know of a better solution. \r\n\r\nA side effect of that is that we won't be able to use gogoprotobuf-generated model (from #773) to generate the JSON for Elasticsearch. The plan would be to move `model/converter/json` code into `plugin/storage/es/dbmodel`, similar to `plugin/storage/cassandra/dbmodel`, while the UI JSON model will be produced directly from protobuf model.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is\u2002[<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/jaegertracing/jaeger/831)\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
