  "body": "## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\nOperate Jaeger Collector that reports to Elasticsearch and Kafka.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\nWhen there's an error with Kafka (missing topic in my case), there are no errors in the logs (even when the log level is set to debug) to help troubleshoot it.\r\n\r\nThe only sign of a problem is that the following metrics`jaeger_kafka_spans_written{status=\"failure\"}` increase over time, but without much information.\r\nThe problem seems to come from the fact that such error are only returned when the messages are flushed to Kafka but it's done asynchronously.\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\nThere's already logging in place when an error is returned by `func (w *SpanWriter) WriteSpan(span *model.Span) error`, but it's not working for Kafka (the error is reported _later_).\r\nI think we should log the errors from the Sarama error channel when we increase the failure metric.\r\n",
