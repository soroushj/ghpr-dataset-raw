  "body": "Jaeger uses the default scheme set by the olivere client (which is http) when sniffing an Elasticsearch cluster without the option to change it.  This makes it impossible to use sniffing with a TLS Elasticsearch cluster.\r\n\r\nThe scheme can be set using the SetScheme client option\r\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/github.com/olivere/elatic/v7\\?tab\\=doc\\#SetScheme\r\n\r\nThis change exposes that client option as a boolean command line option: --es.sniffer-tls-enabled\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: nilsenj <jennynilsen@rentalcars.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe appreciate your contribution to the Jaeger project! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\nBefore creating a pull request, please make sure:\r\n- Your PR is solving one problem\r\n- You have read the guide for contributing\r\n  - See https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n- You signed all your commits (otherwise we won't be able to merge the PR)\r\n  - See https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDELINES.md#certificate-of-origin---sign-your-work\r\n- You added unit tests for the new functionality\r\n- You mention in the PR description which issue it is addressing, e.g. \"Resolves #123\"\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Which problem is this PR solving?\r\nIn our use case, jaeger-collector needs to connect to Elasticsearch running in Kubernetes from outside the cluster.  By using sniffing, we can use the ingress for the initial node discovery and then send traffic directly to the elasticsearch nodes without it needing to go through the ingress.\r\nIn our case, when using ingress only (without sniffing) jaeger represents a substantial proportion of the ingress traffic.  When we switched to using sniffing we were able to reduce the load on our ingress 10x.\r\nIf Elasticsearch is running with TLS enabled, then we need a way to tell jaeger-collector to use https when connecting to the discovered nodes.\r\n\r\n## Short description of the changes\r\n- \r\n",
