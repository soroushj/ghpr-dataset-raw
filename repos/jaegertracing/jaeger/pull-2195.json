  "body": "Resolves #2154 \r\n\r\nThis patch showcases how upstream OTEL components can be extended to support additional means of configuration. In this case I have added `sampling.strategies-file` flag to Jaeger receiver. The configuration in OTEL config has higher precedence over the configuration in Viper (like we do for other jaeger flags).\r\n\r\n* if the flag `sampling.strategies-file` is used and the sampling strategies in the OTEL config is missing it would enable it. e.g.: \r\n\r\n```\r\ngo run main.go --config=/home/ploffay/tmp/otel-config.yml  --sampling.strategies-file=/home/ploffay/tmp/sampling.json\r\nreceivers:\r\n  jaeger:\r\n    protocols:\r\n      grpc:  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let's talk about how this approach could work for other flags. Flags that don't have a default value can be supported easily. However flags with a default value e.g. `--collector.http-server.host-port=:14268` are problematic. The problem is that when the default config is created we don't know whether this endpoint should be enabled or disabled as there is always a default value. When the collector is started without a configuration file it's not a problem because we enable all Jaeger endpoints. However when the collector is started with a configuration file the default value in the flag  always enables the endpoint - which might be problematic if users want to disable the endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
