We would still want the Jaeger UI to query against our ES cluster. Our production Kafka clusters are Kerberos secured.\r\n<!-- required section -->\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\nJaeger does not provide a mechanism to connect to a Kerberos secured Kafka cluster. \r\n\r\n<!-- required section -->\r\n<!-- If possible, describe the impact of the problem. -->\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\n<!-- It's ok if you don't have one. -->\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\n<!-- Questions that should be answered before proceeding with implementation. -->\r\n",
