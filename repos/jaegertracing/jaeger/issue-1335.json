  "body": "## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\nUse Kafka in between Jaeger Collector and Jaeger Ingester\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\nWe see a great number of errors like the following (running v1.9.0):\r\n```\r\n{\"level\":\"error\",\"ts\":1550003610.8029132,\"caller\":\"kafka/writer.go:59\",\"msg\":\"kafka server: Message was too large, server rejected it to avoid allocation error.\",\"stacktrace\":\"github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/plugin/storage/kafka.NewSpanWriter.func2\\n\\t/home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/plugin/storage/kafka/writer.go:59\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, the topic was created with the default `max.message.bytes` value: `1000012` and the broker has a bigger `max.messages.bytes` then the topic.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought the issue was that we received a single big span, but even after switching from `json` to `protobuf` we are still seeing it (I presume `protobuf` is slightly more compact than `json`).\r\n\r\nI started digging and I think the problem is actually with Sarama: https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/issues/1140\r\n\r\nThis seems to be fixed by this: https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/commit/4c93f1f002740d2d8604ba4f82d2c87a4d49a1ba\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n1. Upgrade to Sarama to 1.20.1 (currently at 1.20.0)\r\n2. Ideally, I would like to expose the `MaxMessageBytes` config and the `CompressionCodec` as well\r\n3. Expose more stats from Sarama (these would be helpful https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/blob/46cf3e2cf1acef7876068f66cf69ec31aad2d0b2/produce_request.go#L78-L79)\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n- I plan to send a PR for 1 and another one for 2 and 3\r\n",
