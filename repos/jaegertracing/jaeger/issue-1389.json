  "body": "## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\n\r\nWe want to merge some PRs (#760, #1311) that have very good test coverage, but not 100%, because some error checking code is very hard to test. For example, `x509.SystemCertPool()` returns an error when run on Windows, and we never test on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\n\r\nCurrent `.codecov` settings prevent merging PRs with less than 100% coverage.\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nAt a recent project video call we discussed that we may want to lower the target levels for PRs and the repo overall.\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\nWhat are the new targets that we want to set? The PR target cannot be too aggressive because with small PRs one missed error check can lower the coverage significantly. Maybe PR=75%? The project target should stay reasonably high, e.g. 90% or even 95%.\r\n",
