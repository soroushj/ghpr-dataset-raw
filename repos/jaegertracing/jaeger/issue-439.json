  "body": "Currently ES store does not use bulk API and issues a request to ES for every span. This is not very efficient, but in combination with transaction log flushing leads to performance issues.\r\n\r\nThe [default setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-translog.html#_translog_settings_2) of `index.translog.durability` is `request` which means that there is a fsync after every request. This leads to pretty high IOPS when not using bulk API. \r\nFor example it's the main factor limiting throughput on AWS instances with small EBS drives - that was the reason why I was experiencing 60+ seconds of delay in indexing and losing 50%-75% of spans because the internal queue was always full.\r\n\r\nOne (simple) solution would be to change `index.translog.durability` to `async` in the index settings and make it flush asynchronously. In case of a node crash few seconds of data would be lost which might be acceptable in practice.\r\nAnother option is to start using bulk API. https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki/BulkProcessor can be utilized to avoid writing batching logic by hand.",
