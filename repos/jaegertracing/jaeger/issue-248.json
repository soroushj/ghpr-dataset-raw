  "body": "I would like to more formally define Zipkin compatibility. What is currently supported and what will be supported in the future.\r\n\r\nCurrently we accept zipkin spans in thrift format over HTTP. Default endpoint is `http://localhost:14268/api/traces?format=zipkin.thrift`.\r\n\r\nDefault Zipkin endpoint is `http://localhost:9411/api/v1/spans` with `Content-Type` `thrift` or `json` and optional `gzip` encoding.\r\n\r\nThe difference makes it hard to send data from zipkin instrumentations to jaeger server. In some cases it requires changes in zipkin tracers because of the hardcoded path (`/api/v1/spans`) and often it's not possible to configure sender with a custom query param (`format=zipkin.thrift`).\r\n\r\nWe should consider supporting the same endpoint on the jaeger side to make migrations easier. \r\n\r\n",
