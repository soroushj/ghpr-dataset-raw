  "body": "## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\n\r\nOur Jaeger installation is currently constrained by the number of tag indexes written into Cassandra/Scylla.  We are ingesting ~7.5k spans/second and ~75k tag indexes/second.\r\n\r\nWe would like a central place to control/reduce the number of tags we index.  This would allow us to increase our sampling rate and capture more spans/second.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\n\r\nThe Jaeger Cassandra StorageFactory internally has support for tag filters, but they are not configurable: \r\nhttps://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/plugin/storage/cassandra/spanstore/writer.go#L124\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nExpose two simple filters that allow for tag indexing control:\r\n\r\n`cassandra.tag-index-blacklist`\r\n`cassandra.tag-index-whitelist`\r\n\r\nThese two filters would be a comma delimited list of tags to white or blacklist by exact match.  They would be mutually exclusive.  \r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\nNone.\r\n",
