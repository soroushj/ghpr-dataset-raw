  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe are using ElasticSearch to store our Jaeger traces, and we would like to perform additional queries on this data outside of Jaeger. However, the logs that Jaeger sends to ElasticSearch do not have a viable timestamp field, which makes querying this data externally very difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nI understand that Jaeger intentionally saves the StartTime field as a Long type in ES, because ES does not support dates with microsecond accuracy. If Jaeger saved the StartTime field as Date, ES would cut off the timestamp to milisecond accuracy, losing valuable precision.\r\n\r\nZipkin works around this issue by adding an additional field, timestamp_milis, which ES can use as a date field for sorting. I looked into implementing this in Jaeger myself, but I have little to no experience with Go.\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding a similar solution in Jaeger, as it would greatly increase the value of using ElasticSearch as a storage backend.",
