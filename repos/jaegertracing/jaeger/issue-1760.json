These are signed by trusted Certificate Authorities, so the expectation is that the agent would trust them by default.  However, these are not trusted today by the Jaeger agent. \r\n<!-- required section -->\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\nCA certificates are not loaded into the jaeger-agent container.\r\n<!-- required section -->\r\n<!-- If possible, describe the impact of the problem. -->\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\nLoad the cacerts package from alpine similar to how OpenTelemetry service does it.\r\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-service/blob/master/cmd/otelsvc/Dockerfile#L5\r\n<!-- It's ok if you don't have one. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Questions that should be answered before proceeding with implementation. -->\r\n",
