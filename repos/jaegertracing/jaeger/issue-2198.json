  "body": "At the moment Jaeger OTEL collector can be started without configuration fine. When the configuration file is missing Jaeger uses an opinionated configuration and installs a set of OTEL components (Jaeger receiver, batch processor, etc.). These components can be configured via old Jaeger flags.\r\n\r\nWhen the file is provided the default configuration is not being used and the configuration in flags are not used at all - unless the component (ES exporter) if enabled in the config.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to make Jaeger OTEL collector use its opinionated configuration even when the configuration file is provided. The configurations would be merged and the file would have higher precedence (it allows to disable components if needed). Now the configuration from flags would be always used. In the most common cases, users would just provide an additional configuration in the conf file - e.g. attribute processor or tune retry/batch processors.\r\n\r\nThis would also simplify deployment in of Jaeger OTEL collector in the Jaeger Operator. The operator could expose CR field (yaml) where the additional configuration could be specified.\r\n\r\n",
