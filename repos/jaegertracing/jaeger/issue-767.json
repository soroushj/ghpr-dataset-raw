  "body": "We've been observing Jaeger components - specifically the collectors and query - fail to recover after Cassandra has any sort of outage. While Cassandra reliability is clearly not a topic for here ;), Jaeger's resilience to issues is.\r\n\r\nWhat we see happen is this a stuck process which is only logging one thing even hours after the issue is fixed... ```gocql: no hosts available in the pool```\r\n\r\nWhat we'd like to see happen is a recovery after a few minutes without manual intervention. This is related to, but distinct from, #562 \r\n\r\n",
