We've seen this happen with Cassandra, and is probably an issue with any storage engine that doesn't gracefully degrade. \r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\nnone\r\n<!-- required section -->\r\n<!-- If possible, describe the impact of the problem. -->\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\nAdding a configurable rate limiter to the Kafka reader will enable operators to set a safe throughput target. \r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\nWhat would be a sensible default value?\r\n",
