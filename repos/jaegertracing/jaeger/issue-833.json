  "body": "## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\nI think it would be nice to be able to add tag at the Agent level. It would be similar to adding the tag at the Tracer level via `JAEGER_TAGS` environment variable\r\n\r\nHere's some example of the tags we like to be able to inject into each traces:\r\n- AWS Instance metadata (similar to https://github.com/takus/fluent-plugin-ec2-metadata\r\n- Kubernetes metadata (similar to https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.13/filter/kubernetes.html)\r\n- IP address (if you run the Agent and the application with the Tracer in different container, they will likely have different IP address)\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\nI don't there's anything blocking this, it's a feature request\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\nAbility to provide Jaeger Agent with tags at startup (via something similar to JAEGER_TAGS)\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n- Should these tags be stored and displayed like the Tracer tags? (under the `Process` section in the Query UI)\r\n\r\n_edited to remove the plugin proposition and to reflect the latest state of the request_",
