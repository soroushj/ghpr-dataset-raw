  "body": "## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\n\r\nIn order to increase spans throughput to Cassandra we need more control over what is indexed.  Currently all logs are being indexed.  Once https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1904 is merged we will have more control, but it would be nice to just disable log indexing all together.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\n\r\nThere is a partial implementation already: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/plugin/storage/cassandra/spanstore/dbmodel/log_fields_filter.go\r\n\r\nIt just needs to be exposed as a configuration option.\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nAdd a boolean configuration option to the Cassandra backend `index-logs` that defaults to true.\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\nNone\r\n",
