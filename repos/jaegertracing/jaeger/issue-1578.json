E.g. for a trace with ID `0123`, all of the spans returned refer to trace ID `123`.\r\n\r\nFor each trace returned by jaeger-query, this applies to:\r\n\r\n* The trace ID on the root of the trace data object\r\n* The trace ID fields in each span\r\n* The trace ID fields in internal references \r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nThe zeros should not be stripped.
