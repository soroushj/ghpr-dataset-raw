  "body": "I was looking through tcpdump of an ingester with elasticsearch storage backend and found that index existence is checked a lot of times. Not only that, but index is also created a lot of times.\r\n\r\nIf I change the `SpanWriter` to log every attempt:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nexists, _ := s.client.IndexExists(indexName).Do(s.ctx) // don't need to check the error because the exists variable will be false anyway if there is an error\r\nfmt.Printf(\"checked if index exists = %v (writer = %p)\\n\", exists, s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see that it's triggered 1000+ times on ingester startup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchecked if index exists = true (writer = 0xc000340320)\r\nchecked if index exists = true (writer = 0xc000340320)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy suggestion here is to serialize `SpanWriter::createIndex` with a mutex as there isn't really a good reason to try to do this more than once.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
