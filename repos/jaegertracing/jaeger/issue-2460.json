There's also some open discussion about this over at the Helm chart repo: https://github.com/jaegertracing/helm-charts/issues/41\r\n\r\nI would suggest adding a USER directive to the end of the Dockerfile, setting the running user id to `10001`. I can create a PR for this. \r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\n<!-- Questions that should be answered before proceeding with implementation. -->\r\n\r\n* Should a different UID be used by default? - I prefer 10001 to 1001 suggested in https://github.com/jaegertracing/helm-charts/issues/41 as the latter UID is often already used by some account on the host machine.",
