  "body": "## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\n\r\nUse `model/model.proto` to generate code in other languages.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\n\r\nThe `model/model.proto` currently contains a lot of gogoproto options needed to make the internal domain model types more efficient. While these annotations are optional for other languages, the file does not compile if the compiler does not have access to the gogoproto IDLs.\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nThere are two ways we can go about solving this problem:\r\n\r\n1. Write a script that strips the gogoproto annotations before compiling the IDL in other languages.\r\n1. Create a reusable Docker image for generating code in all languages, which includes all the dependent IDLs, including gogoproto.\r\n",
