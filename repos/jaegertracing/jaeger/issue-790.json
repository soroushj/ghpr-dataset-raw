  "body": "While most SASI indexes were removed as part of #80, the one in the dependencies column family still exists, leading to problems when using older versions of cassandra that don't support SASI indexes, or using [alternate storage like ScyllaDB ](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/201#discussion_r121197772).\r\n\r\nWe can update the `dependency` schema to not have SASI indexes, and provide a migration script from the old schema to the new schema. \r\n\r\nWe should also ensure that https://github.com/jaegertracing/spark-dependencies works with the new schema.",
