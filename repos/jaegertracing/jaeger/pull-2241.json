  "body": "This PR makes Jaeger receiver and exporter fully configurable by flags. \r\n\r\nResolves #2181\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell:\r\n* Each component exposes its flags via `AddFlags()`\r\n* There is a high level `AddComponentFlags()` that adds flags for all components except storage exporters. This is used in every main to add flags to cobra\r\n* `AddFlags` from legacy jaeger packages are split into `AddOTELFlags` to make sure we add only flags that are needed\r\n* Bumps OTEL version that contains TLS fixes for Jaeger exporter/receiver.\r\n\r\nTodos:\r\n- [x] mTLS test that wires gRPC receiver and exporter  - done in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/962\r\n- [x] add missing flags to collector and agent",
