  "body": "Metrics exported from the \"production\" images (not all-in-one though) are not \"namespaced\". If you have a Prometheus that monitors dozens of apps, you can have thousands of metrics. The names of Jaeger metrics (i.e. `IndexCreate:attempts`) are very not friendly to this situation. Normally I would expect a binary names jaeger-collector to export metrics starting with `jaeger_collector_`. This is the case with the all-in-one binary, but not the other ones.\r\n\r\nOther less important issues:\r\n- It is common to export metrics with underscores, not CamelCase. Also not an issue in all-in-one binary afaik.\r\n- The `:` in metric names is unique to Jaeger.",
