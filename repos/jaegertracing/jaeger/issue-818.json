It looks like most of the logic is built on things that already existed, and that it would be fairly straightforward to add an ES implementation. Two options come to mind:\r\n1) Allow configuring a second ES cluster for archiving (the same way we do for Cassandra)\r\n2) Use a separate index for archive traces. The `esCleaner.py` script would need to ignore this index.\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\nIt seems like we'd need a different way of dividing up the indexes to support this if we go with option (1) above. Currently we create an index for each day, which probably doesn't make sense for archiving. Option (2) above would solve this inherently.\r\n",
