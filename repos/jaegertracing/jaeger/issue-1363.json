This means that new users will not be able to query dependencies by default.\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nDo a DESC query on the cassandra jaeger keyspace on startup and see if the dependencies_v2 table is available. If so, use v2, else use v1. \r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\nHow will this work with the flag? Should we just go ahead and deprecate it?\r\n",
