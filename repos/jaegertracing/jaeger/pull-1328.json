Resolves #790.\r\n\r\nMigration Path:\r\n1) Run `v001tov002part1.sh` which will copy dependencies into a csv, update the `dependency UDT`, create a new `dependenciesv2` table, and write dependencies from the csv into the `dependenciesv2` table.\r\n2) Run the collector and query services with the cassandra flag `dependency-sasi-disabled=true` which will update jaeger to read from the new `dependenciesv2` table.\r\n3) Update [spark job](https://github.com/jaegertracing/spark-dependencies) to write to the new `dependenciesv2` table (this is a TODO).\r\n4) Run `v001tov002part2.sh` which will delete the old dependency table and the SASI index.\r\n\r\nUsers who wish to continue to use the SASI indices don't have to do anything as the cassandra flag `dependency-sasi-disabled` will default to false. Ideally, users will migrate on their own timeline and we can remove support for the old table in a major version release.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Fix crossdock\r\n- [ ] Actually test",
