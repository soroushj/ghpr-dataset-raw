  "body": "## Which problem is this PR solving?\r\n- Resolves #295;\r\n- The current code seems to go in the direction of graceful shutdown but fails to correctly implement this behavior for all components. For instance, before this PR, the gRPC server would be closed without taking in-flight requests into consideration;\r\n- More thoughtful shutdown order, like in the all-in-one command: the agent is now closed before the collector disappears, preventing messages like the following after `SIGTERM`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: 2020/02/18 13:27:44 grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {127.0.0.1:14250  <nil> 0 <nil>}. Err :connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 127.0.0.1:14250: connect: connection refused\". Reconnecting...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Short description of the changes\r\n- The first commit shows what would be necessary to get a graceful shutdown for the collector\r\n- The second commit moves most of the startup/shutdown logic for the collector into a \"component\". I'm not happy with its current state, especially about its location, but it shows that quite a good amount of code could be removed by adopting this idea. The same could be applied to the other components, but I want to run this idea here first, before spending much time on this refactoring.",
