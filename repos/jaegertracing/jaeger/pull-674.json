  "body": "This adds a tchannel sampling handler and a static sampling strategy store that reads sampling strategies from a json file.\r\n\r\nI added a factory for this so that when we move adaptive sampling over to open source, we can easily extend the existing factory with adaptive sampling and all its flags (I've counted 15 flags at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nLocations of files might be up for debate (should this belong in pkg and plugin?)\r\nDo I even need a separate sampling strategy store? should I just use the sampling handler interface and have a factory for that?\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/661\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Won Jun Jang <wjang@uber.com>",
