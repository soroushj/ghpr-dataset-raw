  "body": "We have recently have upgraded our Jaeger deployment to 1.18. As part of the deployment we are looking into using the Elasticsearch rollover feature. We have however noticed that in parts of the documentation, this is marked as experimental. This has brought up concern about using it in a production deployment. Our plan is currently to utilize it based on the max_size option to keep our indices below a specified size. We have a test cron job that runs every 15 min against the AWS manged ES cluster.\r\n\r\nIs this feature one that is safe for production deployment? Are there any concerns we should keep in mind because of the experimental label?",
