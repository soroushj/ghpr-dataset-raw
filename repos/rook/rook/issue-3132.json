  "body": "I am not sure where the problem is but I am seeing very high CPU usage since I started using v1.0.0. With three small clusters load average skyrockets to the 10s quite quickly making the nodes unusable. This happens while copying quite a bit of data to a volume mapped on the host bypassing k8s (to restore data from an existing non-k8s server). Nothing else is happening with the clusters at all. I am using low specs servers (2 cores, 8 GB of RAM) but I didn't see any of these high load issues with 0.9.3 on same-specs servers. \r\nHas something changed about Ceph or else that might explain this? I've also tried with two providers, Hetzner Cloud and UpCloud. Same issue when actually using a volume.\r\n\r\nIs it just me or is it happening to others as well? Thanks!\r\n\r\n",
