It typically starts as not schedulable, then it's not ready, then it's finally marked as Ready. With the new event that triggers an orchestration when a new node is added, we observed that OSDs were not installed on the node because the node wasn't in Ready state. \r\n\r\n@shaas Are the new events supposed to be triggered based on the Ready state? There are several filters in that event handler and I'm wondering if we either aren't getting that event or if we are filtering it too aggressively. \r\n\r\nThe workaround was to restart the operator and we saw the osd was started on the new node.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe orchestration should be triggered when a node is schedulable and ready so that new OSDs can be configured on the new node(s).\r\n",
