Then when a cluster crd is created, the operator can make decisions about what osd pods to deploy, one for each device. \r\n\r\nThis will be a new daemon that would run on any node that is labeled to be used as a storage node.\r\n\r\nWhen Rook starts consuming local storage PVs, this device discovery will become obsolete.",
