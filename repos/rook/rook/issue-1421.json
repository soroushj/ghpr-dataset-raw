  "body": "Rook officially maintains support for 1.6.x and a YMMV support for 1.5.x. I think it is time to drop support for both of them. Rook strives to run natively and to be deeply integrated on Kubernetes. Rook does this by leveraging the K8S extensibility via CRDs.\r\n\r\nCRDs were introduced on 1.7. Prior to that, Rook relied on TPRs which has been deprecated and removed from Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nDropping support for K8S 1.6x will make the upgrade and support a lot smoother in the future. We dont have to worry about converting all our TPR objects into CRDs. ",
