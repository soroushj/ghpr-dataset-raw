We need to find a better way to set the timeout so we don't get the false positives. For now we should likely just increase the timeout, perhaps from 10s to 30s.\r\n\r\nIn this attempt, creating the user timed out twice before the final attempt succeeded.\r\n```\r\nroot@rook-client:/# rook object user create rook-user \"A rook rgw User\"\r\nfailed to create user: Post http://10.3.0.187:8124/objectstore/users: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\r\nroot@rook-client:/# rook object user create rook-user \"A rook rgw User\"\r\nfailed to create user: Post http://10.3.0.187:8124/objectstore/users: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\r\nroot@rook-client:/# rook object user create rook-user \"A rook rgw User\"\r\nUser Created\r\n```",
