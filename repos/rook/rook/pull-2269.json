  "body": "<!-- Please take a look at our [Contributing](https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/development-flow.html)\r\ndocumentation before submitting a Pull Request!\r\nThank you for contributing to Rook! -->\r\n\r\n**Description of your changes:**\r\nThe OSDs will now be provisioned by the ceph-volume tool. Rook will no longer manage the partitioning of the devices. This will be handled by ceph-volume. Long term this will keep all the provisioning code in one place for Ceph, and no need for Rook to continue shipping our own partitioning. Implements the design in #2242. \r\n\r\nThe functionality implemented thus far includes:\r\n- ceph-volume is called to provision osds on new devices with `ceph-volume lvm batch --prepare`\r\n- ceph-volume is called to detect what osds are already configured on devices, both to return the results to the operator and to be idempotent on later runs (`ceph-volume lvm list`)\r\n- when the osd daemon is started, `ceph-volume lvm activate` is first called to mount the config. This requires copying the rook binary into the ceph/ceph container.\r\n- OSDs provisioned by rook for directories will remain untouched. Per #2242 we may consider deprecating these.\r\n- OSDs previously provisioned by rook on devices will remain managed by rook, rather than converting to ceph-volume\r\n- ceph-volume is tested to confirm if a supported version is found in the ceph image. The `--activate` option was just merged to master, so it can currently only be run with nautilus. Otherwise, rook falls back to provision OSDs with its own implementation. After that has been backported to luminous and mimic, we can consider only supporting ceph images with that change.\r\n- Support for multiple OSDs per device\r\n- Support for encrypted OSDs\r\n\r\nRemaining for the PR:\r\n- Testing upgrading from 0.8. Previous OSDs should remain untouched.\r\n- Setting the option for encrypted OSDs causes the provisioning job to hang in the call to ceph-volume. (The latest clue is that some bind mount is missing in the osd provisioning pod. See the [gist](https://gist.github.com/travisn/dce67953da35c4c75fb7490623d63165) with details.). For now, encryption will not be exposed and will see if we can enable it in a dot release.\r\n- Confirm that it works with luminous and mimic if the ceph-volume changes have been backported in time for the merge\r\n- Update documentation for when the new ceph-volume features are available (you need a recent build with ceph-volume)\r\n\r\n**Which issue is resolved by this Pull Request:**\r\nResolves #1342 \r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n- [X] Documentation has been updated, if necessary.\r\n- [X] Pending release notes updated with breaking and/or notable changes, if necessary.\r\n- [ ] Upgrade from previous release is tested and upgrade user guide is updated, if necessary.\r\n- [X] Code generation (`make codegen`) has been run to update object specifications, if necessary.\r\n- [X] Comments have been added or updated based on the standards set in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#comments)\r\n",
