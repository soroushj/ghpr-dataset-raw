  "body": "For mon and osd pods to support restart, the `dataDirHostPath` must currently be set on the cluster.yaml. The real solution is to build on the K8s local storage feature as described in #796. In the meantime, setting the host path is a necessary tradeoff.\r\n\r\nWith the host path set, the challenge is that if the cluster is torn down and a new cluster created, the path on the host must be deleted. Otherwise, stale keys will be used to start the services and they will fail. At a minimum we can have an error message logged so it is clear why the daemon is not starting. We could potentially have the rook agent clean up this directory, but hold off on that change for now since we will be moving to local storage soon.",
