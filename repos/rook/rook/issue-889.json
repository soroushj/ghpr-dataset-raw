Rook could set it when creating pools, but it would be nice to understand what the significance of this app tag really is.\r\n\r\nNote, I was able to get rid of the warning by running the following command in the rook toolbox (the pool named `replicapool` was the offending pool):\r\n```\r\nceph osd pool application enable replicapool myapp\r\n```",
