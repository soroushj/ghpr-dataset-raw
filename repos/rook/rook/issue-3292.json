  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Deviation from expected behavior:**\r\nWhen a Kubernetes node fails and Rook is waiting for the OSDs to come back online or to time out, the warning messages output to the operator log are unclear, and this has confused at least one user from Slack.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-06-12 20:53:09.332900 I | op-osd: osd.3 is marked 'DOWN'\r\n2019-06-12 20:53:09.332914 W | op-osd: waiting for the osd.3 to exceed the grace period\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe warning message is not very clear. It should state why Rook is waiting, what will happen after the grace period, what the grace period is, and how much time is left until the period is crossed. For example, ```OSD 3 is unavailable. Waiting for a grace period of GRACE_PERIOD seconds/minutes before assuming the OSD is gone forever, at which point the OSD will be removed from the Ceph cluster. TIME_REMAINING seconds/minutes remain in the grace period. It is natural to see the pod corresponding to this OSD waiting in \"Pending\" state at this time.```\r\n\r\nWhen the OSD grace period is passed, I would expect the message to contain much of the same information. For example, ```OSD 3 has been unavailable for TIME_UNAVAILABLE seconds/minutes. This exceeds the allowed grace period of GRACE_PERIOD seconds/minutes. The OSD will now be removed from the Ceph cluster.```\r\n\r\nIt is also not clear whether Rook is observing its own grace period or whether it is allowing Ceph to mark the OSD `out` according to Ceph's own grace period.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\nStart a multi-node Rook cluster, and kill one of the nodes.",
