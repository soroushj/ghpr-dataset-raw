So it can't be mounted on to the clean up job as a volume)\r\n- Clean up job deletes a mon directory only if this monitor secret matches with the key in '/dataDirHostPath/mon-*/data/keyring'\r\n\r\n**Which issue is resolved by this Pull Request:**\r\nResolves #5131\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Reviewed the developer guide on [Submitting a Pull Request](https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/development-flow.html#submitting-a-pull-request)\r\n- [ ] Documentation has been updated, if necessary.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests have been added, if necessary.\r\n- [ ] Integration tests have been added, if necessary.\r\n- [ ] Pending release notes updated with breaking and/or notable changes, if necessary.\r\n- [ ] Upgrade from previous release is tested and upgrade user guide is updated, if necessary.\r\n- [ ] Code generation (`make codegen`) has been run to update object specifications, if necessary.\r\n- [ ] Comments have been added or updated based on the standards set in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#comments)\r\n- [ ] Add the flag for skipping the CI if this PR does not require a build.
