  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\n\r\nFor every Ceph container we should configure an admin socket\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for both troubleshooting, and so that we could injectargs in emergency situations.\r\n\r\nExample of troubleshooting might be inspecting the admin socket of the monitors to see why they are unable to form quorum. Another might be inspecting the runtime memory_target setting on any given OSD.\r\n\r\nThe use of injectargs is very handy for large clusters when you need to quickly make a change to a daemons runtime without churning through deleting pods. Think dynamically changing recovery settings (max backfills).\r\n\r\n",
