  "body": "commitlint bot is now deprecated https://github.com/z0al/commitlint-bot, it hasn't been updated for years and its maintainers recommend going with https://github.com/apps/semantic-pull-requests instead. Which seems to be a bit more powerful.  commitlint was lacking flexibility and it seems nobody understood it despite our various efforts.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to go with semantic-pull-requests, which will work with basic rules and requires proper PR as well as commit semantic. It does not print any comment in the PR, the PR status check will be red and it will indicate the reason.\r\n\r\nOne addition I'm thinking about is to use mergify to react on a failure of this check and post a proper message (written by us) that contains what we except. See the example of the rule: https://doc.mergify.io/examples.html#request-for-action.\r\n\r\nSemantic example https://github.com/leseb/Scripts/pull/6 where it's complaining about the title of PR being incorrect. We can decide between PR and/or commit.",
