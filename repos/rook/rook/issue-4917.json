  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\n\r\nCurrently we need to configure the Ceph external Admin key in the Rook deployment to be able to connect to a external Ceph cluster.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to run in a multi-tenant fashion were several K8s/Rook clusters wanted to connect to the same external ceph cluster, each K8s deployment would have the access to the External Ceph Admin key and could potentially access or delete the Data from pools that belong to other k8s/Rook Clusters.\r\n\r\nFor deployments were we\u2019re not configuring RGW or MDS in rook, if we could remove the need to use the external ceph admin key, we could then configure a specific user for each k8s/rook deployment with a delimited set of caps that would only allow to access their data pools achieving data isolation per k8s/rook deployment\r\n\r\n \r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\n\r\nMulti-Tenancy, Achieving Data Isolation For different tenants/k8s/rook deployments while sharing the same Ceph External Cluster.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n<!-- Specific environment information that helps with the feature request -->\r\n",
