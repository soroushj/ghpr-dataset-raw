    "description": "Kubernetes Operator is expanded to provide full lifecycle support for the Rook components with a focus on getting the RADOS layer (MON and OSD) to be reliable. We will be building a new volume plugin for Kubelet that improves the overall experience of using Rook storage. Also more support for integration into Kubernetes API through third-party resources.\r\n\r\nAdd support for Ceph's filestore which is production-grade now. Rook will support Kraken (default) and Luminous (option) in this milestone.\r\n\r\nAdd initial monitoring support for Rook through Prometheus. \r\n\r\nImprove the build process so that Rook releases come out of Jenkins and add integration testing.",
