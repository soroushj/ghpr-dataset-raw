Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Deviation from expected behavior:**\r\nDuring a Rook upgrade, there is no need to restart the Ceph daemons unless there is an important update to the daemon pod spec. If the rook image only changed, that only impacts the init container and basic daemon startup and there is not a need to restart the Ceph daemon. \r\n\r\nThe remaining reason (after #4362) that we need the rook image in the osd daemon pod is in order to call `ceph-volume activate` so the osd can access the config from the `prepare`. If we can remove the need for the `ceph-volume activate` command, we could remove the need for the OSDs to be restarted during every rook upgrade. This can cause unnecessary downtime at least briefly during an upgrade. This would require changes to `ceph-volume` provide a different way to start the osd daemon without requiring the activate.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nOSDs should not restart during every rook upgrade.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\n- Upgrade the rook version such as from v1.1.6 to v1.1.7.\r\n- See the osd pods restarted\r\n",
