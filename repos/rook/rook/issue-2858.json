For general technical and non-technical questions, we are happy to help you on our [Rook.io Slack](https://Rook-io.slack.com).\r\n3. Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Deviation from expected behavior:**\r\nMultiple orchestrations are allowed at a time, which has undesired side effects.\r\n[This line](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/pkg/operator/ceph/cluster/cluster.go#L148) allows every goroutine to start an orchestration at the same time.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nOnly one orchestration should be allowed at a time. Here is a prototype commit that worked locally for me in the integration test, I don't believe it is a complete solution.\r\nhttps://github.com/travisn/rook/commit/1e463349dbeb3416b9751c8d3e28a7d9b99074e5\r\n\r\nWe need to call `setOrchestrationPending()` wherever it's intended to trigger an orchestration, such as where the crd is updated, or when a node is added. Looks like that method is not being called in those scenarios.\r\n\r\n@shaas can you take a look at this? thanks\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\n- kubectl create -f operator.yaml\r\n- kubectl create -f cluster.yaml\r\n- kubectl create -f filesystem.yaml\r\n- restart the operator pod\r\n\r\nThere are at least a couple of side effects of the issue:\r\n- Logs are in the operator log that show two orchestrations are happening simultaneously\r\n- As seen in the upgrade integration test, you may see a panic inside the operator pod where the filesystem is not able to access the `clusterInfo` object because it hasn't been initialized since the mons are down. If only one orchestration is allowed, the operator is prevented from proceeding with the filesystem config.\r\n",
