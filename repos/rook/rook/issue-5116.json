  "body": "** Feature Request **\r\nEnhance `CephBlockPools` and `CephFilesystem` CRD to additionally support Bluestore compression enabled pools.\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nThe feature request is to add an additional `compression` parameter in the above CRDs that can be set to a desired compression mode as defined by Bluestore per pool compression [modes](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/configuration/bluestore-config-ref/#inline-compression).\r\n\r\nThis enables creating backing pools for RBD and CephFS data, that are enabled for Bluestore compression.\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\nCompression helps reduce total storage in-use and thus provides a better usable capacity. The trade-off is between some lost CPU performance (the attempt to compress) to gain possible compression based storage usage reduction.\r\n\r\nThus, for users/workloads that either have compressible data, or are willing to make the performance trade-off, this feature would help setup pools with the said properties.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Ideally to leverage these compressed pools, the kubernetes admin would have to create relevant StorageClasses that uses these compression enabled pools to provision from.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\nI would state, this applies to all environments.\r\n\r\n",
