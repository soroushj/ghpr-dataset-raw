  "body": "While trying to debug an issue I'm having, I noticed that there are a couple of issues with the kubernetes go client that might impact the stability of Rook builds.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the import for `k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes`, as noted by client-go's readme, will pull the unstable master version of the client.\r\nhttps://github.com/rook/rook/blob/c93d4dadebc0dd27fe5199983342ec6b90a7fbaf/pkg/operator/agent/agent.go#L35\r\n\r\nSecondly, the `clientset.Core()` method is deprecated and should be replaced with `clientset.CoreV1()` per https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/18ec62fe90328a54f7ab513d5fedf3e8650c98b5/kubernetes/clientset.go#L274\r\nhttps://github.com/rook/rook/blob/c93d4dadebc0dd27fe5199983342ec6b90a7fbaf/pkg/operator/agent/agent.go#L221\r\n\r\nSearching the Rook codebase to replace `clientset.Core()` with `clientset.CoreV1()` will be trivial, but I think there should be a larger conversation around the client-go versioning.",
