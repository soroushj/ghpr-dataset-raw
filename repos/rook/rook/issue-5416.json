Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Deviation from expected behavior:**\r\nWhen the operator runs a reconcile (e.g. during upgrade), the OSD may stay pending indefinitely due to an invalid node selector:\r\n```\r\nEvents:\r\n  Type     Reason            Age        From               Message\r\n  ----     ------            ----       ----               -------\r\n  Warning  FailedScheduling  <unknown>  default-scheduler  0/6 nodes are available: 6 node(s) didn't match node selector.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can happen if the following conditions are met:\r\n- The OSD is configured on a PVC (with a storageClassDeviceSet)\r\n- `portable: false`\r\n- The existing OSD pod is down while the operator reconciles the OSDs\r\n\r\nThe operator tries to lookup the node assignment for the OSD from the existing pod, which is assumed to be running. But if the pod is down for some reason (the node was rebooted or drained), the OSD will not be currently assigned while the node is unavailable. This results in a blank node selector when the operator updates the OSD deployment spec.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe operator needs to lookup the existing OSD deployment's node selector instead of relying on the `nodeName` from the pod spec, which would be blank while the node is down.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\n- Install a cluster on PVC\r\n- Restart a node with an OSD\r\n- Restart the operator, which would reconcile the OSDs while the OSD pod is down.\r\n- See the OSD deployment spec updated with a blank node selector and stay pending indefinitely.\r\n\r\n",
