Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nThe Ceph CRD currently only includes a single status field and the value is only \"creating\" or \"created\". The status should be expanded to include more detailed info that will be useful to users, or even rook itself for scenarios like upgrade where rook needs to know what version or settings were previously applied.\r\n\r\nAdditional status info could include:\r\n- Ceph version info: Major version (luminous | mimic | nautilus) and detailed version number of the ceph image that is detected by the operator\r\n- Detailed orchestration status for mons, mgr, osd, etc. This would help know if the operator is stuck on some part of the orchestration\r\n\r\nThe current status:\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl -n rook-ceph get cephcluster rook-ceph -o yaml\r\n...\r\nstatus:\r\n  state: Created\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\nImprove the visibility into the operator status.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n<!-- Specific environment information that helps with the feature request -->\r\n",
