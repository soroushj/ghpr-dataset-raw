To clean up the devices, the admin has to connect to the host and zap the devices where the OSDs were running. To simplify the cleanup process during uninstall, the operator should start a job that will cleanup the devices. Recently, an addition was made with #4959 that will cleanup the dataDirHostPath. Now we can follow the same pattern with a setting in the cluster CR such as:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  cleanupPolicy:\r\n    zapDevicesWithRemovedOSDs: \"yes-really-destroy-data\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\nCleanup during uninstall is simpler to automate",
