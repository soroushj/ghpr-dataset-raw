  "body": "Since I've started my work on implementing msgr2 support in Rook (https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/2559), I add to implement a Ceph version check, to perform certain operations whether we run Nautilus and above or earlier versions.\r\nCurrently Rook support Luminous, Mimic and Nautilus (let's say partially)\r\n\r\nThe exceptions are going to grow over time, that's a given. The more they grow the more complex the Rook code will be to maintain and years from now we are going to regret it. At first we think, \"yes that's not so much\" and then we keep addind more and more exceptions. I realize this might break Rook's promise to have a single operator *to rule them all* but in the long run that's not worth it.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate that, I believe we should start pinning the support for N number of version of Ceph for a certain version of the Rook operator. One major version of the operator could support up to two Ceph version (so we can handle upgrades).\r\n\r\nRook 1.0 is around the corner and I believe it's a good opportunity to make it Ceph Nautilus only. So basically we would have something like:\r\n\r\n* Rook 0.X supports Luminous and Mimic\r\n* Rook 1.0 supports Nautilus (upgrade path included from Mimic) and Octopus\r\n* Rook 1.1 supports  P (upgrade path included from Octopus) and Q\r\n\r\nSo to go from Mimic to Nautilus, you will have to upgrade the operator first, then trigger your Ceph upgrade to Nautilus.\r\n\r\n@BlaineEXE @travisn @jbw976 @galexrt, @liewegas, @rootfs  please share your thoughts :).",
