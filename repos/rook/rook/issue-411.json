  "body": "Both the `rook-client` and `toolbox` containers are currently build and published manually (I believe it's just those two).  We could improve this with an automated solution that:\r\n- only runs as part of our build scripts when needed (such as at real release time), so these containers aren't built every time a dev builds\r\n- do not rely on a hard coded `rook` version in their `Dockerfile` to download the `rook` binary from github.  Instead they should use the locally built `rook` binary, which would allow these containers to be versioned along with the other release artifacts (`rook`, `rookd`, `rook-operator`)",

    "description": "Kubernetes Operator is expanded to provide full lifecycle support for the Rook components with a focus on getting the RADOS layer (MON and OSD) to be reliable. We will be building a new volume plugin for Kubelet that improves the overall experience of using Rook storage. Also more support for integration into Kubernetes API through third-party resources.\r\n\r\nAdd support for Ceph's filestore which is production-grade now. Rook will support Kraken (default) and Luminous (option) in this milestone.\r\n\r\nAdd initial monitoring support for Rook through Prometheus. \r\n\r\nImprove the build process so that Rook releases come out of Jenkins and add integration testing.",
