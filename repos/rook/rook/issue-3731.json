  "body": "Currently, the external cluster feature is really strict on the Ceph version, it'll fail if the specified image has a different version from the external cluster. Currently it has to be identical.\r\nThis obviously brings an upgrade issue. The external cluster must be upgraded before, no matter what.\r\nAt least, to prevent issues where the external cluster got upgraded to a different minor version let's say from 14.2.2 to 14.2.3, we shouldn't fail if the operator restarts and sees that versions are not different. We should allow the operator to continue but warn that an upgrade should be considered to match the new minor version.\r\nIf the external cluster version goes from 14.2.3 to 15.2.1 we should probably (for safety) reasons fail on the operator and urgently request an upgrade (change the image to point to 15.2.1).",
