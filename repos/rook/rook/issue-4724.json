  "body": "# What's changing in Rook 1.3?\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/4435, Rook is introducing a major refactor in the way OSDs are handled and configured. Essentially, this change will:\r\n\r\n* remove support for Filestore OSDs\r\n  * existing Filestore OSDs will continue to run if on a block device\r\n  * creation of Filestore OSDs is not supported anymore\r\n* remove support for osd running on directories\r\n  * existing OSD running on a directory will continue to run\r\n     * However, if the OSD deployment is deleted, Rook won't bring it up\r\n  * creation of OSD on a directory is **not** possible anymore\r\n* remove support for legacy Rook OSD (non-ceph-volume configured)\r\n  * to identify the legacy Rook OSDs that would be affected, look for the existence of three partitions on a device with labels such as `ROOK-OSD0-BLOCK`\r\n  * existing legacy rook osd will continue to run\r\n    * However, if the OSD deployment is deleted, Rook won't bring it up\r\n  * creation ofa legacy OSD is not possible since ~1.0 when ceph-volume was introduced\r\n\r\n# What should I do?\r\n\r\nWe recommend you to:\r\n\r\n* trash your OSDs one by one\r\n* use partition (possible since https://github.com/rook/rook/releases/tag/v1.2.2) or a full block device to create new bluestore OSDs. Using `useAllDevices: true` is recommended and makes the whole experience easier to automatically create new OSDs. You must be running Ceph 14.2.8 or higher to achieve this since it contains a ceph-volume fix to create OSDs on partitions.\r\n* wait for Ceph to recover\r\n* move to the next OSD\r\n\r\n# Am I impacted by this change?\r\n\r\nYou are not impacted if your OSDs are running on block devices and use Bluestore, otherwise, you are.\r\n\r\n# What if I do nothing?\r\n\r\nIf you fall into the cases listed in the first part of the document your OSDs won't start anymore and your cluster will be unusable. It's highly recommended to act as presented in the second section.",
