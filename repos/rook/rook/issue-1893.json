Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nThe Helm chart already allows a `nodeSelector` to be set for Rook operator pods, but in order to fully control pod placement, it also needs to allow `tolerations` to be set for operator pods.\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\nI am setting up a cluster which has nodes specifically reserved for infrastructure (in-cluster storage, monitoring, logging, etc.). In order to achieve this, I set both a label and a taint on the infrastructure nodes. With the current Helm chart, I am able to get the operator pods to target the infrastructure nodes, but because they do not tolerate the taint they don't get scheduled.\r\n",
