For general technical and non-technical questions, we are happy to help you on our [Rook.io Slack](https://slack.rook.io/).\r\n3. Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\nFollow-up from security review with [TrailOfBits](https://www.trailofbits.com/):\r\n\r\nThis is faulty logic surrounding the removal of a finalizer. If the cast of \u200bobj\u200b fails, the finalizer will be reported as removed.\r\nIf \u200bobj\u200b is not successfully cast into an e\u200b dgefsv1.Cluster\u200b, \u200bok\u200b will be \u200bfalse\u200b, resulting in the .Update(cluster)\u200b operation not running, and the declared \u200berr\u200b variable retaining its default \u200bnil\u200b value. Subsequently, a check against e\u200brr\u200b is performed, which will evaluate to false\u200b, resulting in logging the finalizer as removed when it in fact was not.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"854\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-20 at 12 48 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1048514/71287994-0999ea00-2327-11ea-9775-d6ce07ca8391.png\">\r\n\r\nRecommendation\r\nShort term, fix the logic to correctly report type assertion errors and refrain from reporting the finalizer as removed.\r\nLong term, improve validation related to the removal of finalizers. Check to ensure all finalizers have been removed after the removal process has finished.",
