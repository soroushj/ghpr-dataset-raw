  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhen standing up a Rook cluster one can ignore the option above to be set to true when not on a Openshift install.\r\nHowever, if you're running your cluster with SElinux enabled and enforcing the ceph-crash-collector pods will fail and block the overall deployment.\r\n\r\nThe current description states:\r\n```\r\n# Whether to start pods as privileged that mount a host path, which includes the Ceph mon and osd pods.\r\n# This is necessary to workaround the anyuid issues when running on OpenShift.\r\n# For more details see https://github.com/rook/rook/issues/1314#issuecomment-355799641\r\n```\r\nPlease update it to reference SElinux mitigations as it is much simpler to keep it grouped with the other SElinux related options.\r\nI managed to resolve this configuration issue after i have found  #1911 and #1314\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\nKubernetes 1.18.6 with CRI-O 1.18.2\r\nSELinux enforcing on hosts running Centos8",
