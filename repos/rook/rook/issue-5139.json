But after we manually updated all deployments this error went away and it never again changed the `ROOK_LV_PATH` to the wrong value.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n* OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)\r\n* Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): 4.19.67-2 (from Debian)\r\n* Cloud provider or hardware configuration: Azure VM\r\n* Rook version (use `rook version` inside of a Rook Pod): v1.2.7\r\n* Storage backend version (e.g. for ceph do `ceph -v`): 14.2.8\r\n* Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): v1.14.1\r\n* Kubernetes cluster type (e.g. Tectonic, GKE, OpenShift): Bare metal\r\n* Storage backend status (e.g. for Ceph use `ceph health` in the [Rook Ceph toolbox](https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/ceph-toolbox.html)): HEALTH_OK\r\n",
