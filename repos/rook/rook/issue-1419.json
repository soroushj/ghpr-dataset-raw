Please adjust your usages accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it might make sense to change the arm builds (see `images/image.mk`) to:\r\n`arm32v7` and `arm64v8`. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if adding `arm32v5` or `arm32v6` also makes sense. It depends on what platforms Rook wants to target. v6 is R-Pi FWIW. I wouldn't think that R-Pi needs to be supported, but some people do want to run clusters of R-Pis for fun. I don't see any good reason to support v5.\r\n\r\n",
