The test attempts to delete the crd, remove the finalizer from the crd, and try again. After the finalizer is removed, other resources are also cleaned up that results in the test still failing after retry.\r\n\r\nThe test times out waiting for the mons to start, which they never will.\r\n\r\nThe operator log shows an RBAC issue since service accounts had been cleaned up after the finalizer was removed:\r\n```\r\n2018-09-12 12:33:53.648087 E | op-cluster: failed to create cluster in namespace upgrade-ns. failed to create override configmap upgrade-ns. configmaps is forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:block-test-ns-system:rook-ceph-system\" cannot create configmaps in the namespace \"upgrade-ns\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test needs to ensure all the resources (service accounts, roles, etc) are properly created before continuing with the test.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nSuccessful build\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\nJenkins",
