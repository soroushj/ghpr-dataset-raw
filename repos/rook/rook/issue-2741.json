Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nWhen an OSD is marked `out`, the operator currently only writes a message to the log that the OSD is down and takes no further action. When the OSD is out, we should consider removing the OSD:\r\n- When the OSD is safe to remove (`ceph safe-to-remove`):\r\n  - Delete the OSD deployment\r\n  - Remove the OSD from the crush map\r\n  - Turn on the blinking light (if available)\r\n\r\nWe should consider how aggressive we should be in this case. If a node was down temporarily and comes back online, the OSD should start again so that the PGs still assigned to the OSD won't have to be migrated. We would be covered fairly quickly if the \"add node\" event covered this scenario, but we wouldn't want to trigger an orchestration every time a node restarts either.\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n<!-- Specific environment information that helps with the feature request -->\r\n",
