The mons are expected to only belong to the cluster since it is not supported to use the same `dataDirHostPath` by multiple clusters, but this is an additional verification just to make sure uninstall doesn't affect a live cluster.\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\nEnsure uninstall of one rook cluster never affects the ability of another to run.\r\n",
