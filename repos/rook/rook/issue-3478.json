For general technical and non-technical questions, we are happy to help you on our [Rook.io Slack](https://slack.rook.io/).\r\n3. Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n<!-- Remove only one -->\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Bug Report**\r\nWhen using a custom generated access key and secret key to access the minio object store, I get an error saying `The access key ID you provided does not exist in our records`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nI would be able to login with the generated access keys.\r\n\r\n**Deviation from expected behavior:**\r\nI was deploying the sample code from the [cluster/examples/kubernetes/minio](https://github.com/rook/rook/tree/release-0.9/cluster/examples/kubernetes/minio) directory. The only thing that was modified was the secret containing the username and password fields (respectively access key and secret key used for minio). I then changed the storage class to be what I am using (in this case rook-ceph).\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\nI just `kubectl create -f operator.yaml` and waited for it to come up. Then when it was successful I did a `kubectl create -f object-store.yaml` ensuring to enter my new credentials as base64 encoded values.\r\n\r\nThe `my-store-x` pods came up, I was able to access my minio dashboard via my ingress rule that I defined for it, and upon trying to login to the dashboard with the generated credentials I get the error mentioned above.\r\n\r\nNothing shows in the operator log or the `my-store-x` pods. \r\n\r\nI took the same `object-store.yaml` file and left the default values for credentials (\"`TEMP_DEMO_ACCESS_KEY` and `TEMP_DEMO_SECRET_KEY`\") and redeployed after deleting everything and was able to login.\r\n\r\nI should also note that with the custom credentials, I see them in the pods and statefulset as ENV vars with the correct values. \r\n\r\n**File(s) to submit**:\r\n\r\n* Cluster CR (custom ressource), typically called `cluster.yaml`, if necessary\r\n* Operator's logs, if necessary\r\n* Crashing pod(s) logs, if necessary\r\n\r\n To get logs, use `kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod name>`\r\nWhen pasting logs, always surround them with backticks or use the `insert code` button from the Github UI.\r\nRead [Github documentation if you need help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n* OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 16.04\r\n* Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): \r\n* Cloud provider or hardware configuration: Azure Stack\r\n* Rook version (use `rook version` inside of a Rook Pod): v0.9.3\r\n* Storage backend version (e.g. for ceph do `ceph -v`): ceph 0.9.3\r\n* Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.13.5\r\n* Kubernetes cluster type (e.g. Tectonic, GKE, OpenShift): RKE\r\n* Storage backend status (e.g. for Ceph use `ceph health` in the [Rook Ceph toolbox](https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/ceph-toolbox.html)):\r\n",
