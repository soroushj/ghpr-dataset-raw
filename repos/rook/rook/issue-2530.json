  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nThe cassandra operator should install the necessary plugins, in order for cassandra to export prometheus metrics. We only use plugins that will work as a javaagent. Currently there are various plugins doing that:\r\n- [cassandra-exporter by Instaclustr](https://github.com/instaclustr/cassandra-exporter): Seems to be the best solution but is still a very early project with no Grafana dashboard. If it matures and is maintained, this will most likely be the right choice.\r\n- [jmx-exporter by Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter): Not made specifically for Cassandra, but it does the job. There is also a [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/5408) for it.\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\n\r\nUsers should be able to monitor their Cassandra cluster.\r\nUnfortunately, there's no clear cut solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n:warning: If you have experience monitoring Cassandra using Prometheus and Grafana, please tell us your opinion.\r\n",
