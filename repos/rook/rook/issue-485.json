  "body": "The operator currently starts mon and osd pods always in an EmptyDir. The lifecycle of this directory will be the same as the pods. If the pods go away and are created again by Kubernetes, all local data or metadata will be lost for the mon or osd. \r\n\r\nThe operator should expose the ability to specify a HostPath for the data directory. This means that a directory on the host is created for the generated config files, and data can be stored here for the osd. \r\n\r\nWith #397, we will get more granular ability to set this path on a per-node basis. This issue is about creating a global setting for homogenous environments. \r\n\r\nNote that if a new cluster is started, the user better first clean up the hostPath manually or else select a different path. Otherwise, the new mons and osds will be confused with config files from the previous run.",

    "description": "Kubernetes Operator is expanded to provide full lifecycle support for the Rook components with a focus on getting the RADOS layer (MON and OSD) to be reliable. We will be building a new volume plugin for Kubelet that improves the overall experience of using Rook storage. Also more support for integration into Kubernetes API through third-party resources.\r\n\r\nAdd support for Ceph's filestore which is production-grade now. Rook will support Kraken (default) and Luminous (option) in this milestone.\r\n\r\nAdd initial monitoring support for Rook through Prometheus. \r\n\r\nImprove the build process so that Rook releases come out of Jenkins and add integration testing.",
