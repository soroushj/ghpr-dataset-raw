  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\nThe binary check `k8sutil.GetNodeSchedulable(*newNode)` introduced in #2986 to test for node schedulability will also return true if the node has been tainted as having memory or disk pressure or any number of other well-known taints.\r\n\r\nThere is an unschedulable taint applied when `kubectl cordon` is used, but according to the k8s codebase, this taint can applied any time the node is unschedulable for any condition.\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4cd759dbe0a5239de01ea8ece2d4f73a5dd8706c/pkg/scheduler/api/well_known_labels.go#L35-L38\r\n\r\nTo my logic, there is no way for us to determine that a node has been specifically cordoned for maintenance versus made unschedulable for any number of other reasons. I think we should revert that PR and consider other ways we might be able to mark noout for users.\r\n\r\nIf it is to be a manual step, I think we might want to use a Ceph command to set noout on all the osds of a particular node. We might have to make an issue to get that added to Ceph. \r\n\r\n",
