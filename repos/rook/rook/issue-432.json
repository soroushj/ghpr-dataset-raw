  "body": "The built-in RBD plugin has some limitations and also has a dependency on the `rbd` tool being installed locally.\r\n\r\nWe should explore if there's any improvements we can make with a `rook` volume plugin and if that effort would be worthwhile.   One advantage of a `rook` volume plugin would be the potential removal of the user having to look up monitor IP addresses and secrets themselves, the plugin could do that.\r\n\r\nThis could also take our goal of deep integration with Kubernetes even further.",
