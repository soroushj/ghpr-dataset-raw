  "body": "In a lot of scenarios, the ceph status will show something like `too few PGs per OSD (25 < min 30)`, which can be fairly benign.  The consequences of too few PGs is much less severe than the consequences of too **many** PGs, as explained in this ceph blog post:\r\nhttp://ceph.com/community/new-luminous-pg-overdose-protection/\r\n> If you have way less than that the load distribution won\u2019t be as balanced (some OSDs will store more than others), and if you have too many more than that then each OSD will be coordinating with too many other OSDs, increasing overhead and reducing overall reliability.\r\n\r\nWe should mention this in the docs/FAQs somewhere.",
