  "body": "Currently, when creating a cluster CRD, the cluster name and the namespace it is deployed to must match exactly.  The codebase is not 100% consistent on when it uses cluster name and when it uses the namespace.\r\n\r\nfor instance, i think the dynamic provisioner would fail to create a block image because it would use the wrong cluster name when exec\u2019ing to `rbd`\r\n\r\nwe should either:\r\n* perform an inventory on the codebase and fix all places where a mismatched cluster name/namespace breaks something\r\n* add documentation or validation to enforce early on that cluster name does match the namespace, avoiding issues later on that show up and are harder to debug",
