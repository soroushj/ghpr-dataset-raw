  "body": "With #1362 the Rook project has switched to using ceph Debian packages instead of building it from source. The goal is more alignment between Rook and upstream Ceph.\r\n\r\nThe image hierarchy is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBase Image (Ubuntu minified)\r\n   -> Rook image (ceph installed from deb packages + rook binaries)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `amd64` image ends up being ~180MB compressed with this approach.\r\n\r\nThe ceph-container project has also been working on size reductions in https://github.com/ceph/ceph-container/pull/877, and includes some of the same tricks to minify the base OS as Rook. The ceph-container project has the following hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBase Ubuntu\r\n   -> Ceph image (cleanup of OS + ceph installed from deb packages + etcd + confd etc.)\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe should consider bringing both image together to something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBase Image (Ubuntu minified)\r\n     Ceph Image (minimal ceph binaries installed from deb packages)\r\n            Rook (rook binaries)\r\n            or\r\n            Ceph-Container (etcd + confd + scripts)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever for rook scenarios we would like to include other backends in our single image, and docker does not support multiple base images. If we were to add Gluster to the same Rook image, I think we would still do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBase Image (Ubuntu minified)\r\n     Rook Image (ceph and gluster installed from deb packages + rook binaries)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively Rook could use multiple images for each backend.\r\n",
