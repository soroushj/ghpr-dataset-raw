Something like `make build ceph` should only build the Ceph image and skip others such as CockroachDB or Minio.  Other potential commands could be scoped to single providers, such as `minikube.sh update ceph`.\r\n\r\nWhat would be solved through this feature: Developers time during iteration could be saved by not having to wait on all containers to build.  This will only get worse as more providers are integrated into Rook.\r\n\r\nDoes this have an impact on existing features: It should not, `make build` should still behave exactly as it does today (build container images for all providers)\r\n",
