  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\nToday I updated to Nautilus, and now every OSD is complaining:\r\n\r\n`osd.32 spilled over 11 GiB metadata from 'db' device (1.9 GiB used of 20 GiB) to slow device`\r\n\r\nI found this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.ceph.com/pipermail/ceph-users-ceph.com/2019-February/033286.html\r\n\r\n```\r\nBluestore/RocksDB will only put the next level up size of DB on flash if the whole size will fit.\r\nThese sizes are roughly 3GB,30GB,300GB. Anything in-between those sizes are pointless. Only ~3GB of SSD will ever be used out of a\r\n28GB partition.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRook by default creates a 20GB partitions, from which only 3 are actually used (not sure about the newer scheme, probably the same?)\r\n\r\nI have the cluster with 1.7PB total, 700 TB used, installed long ago, so it has an old scheme with symlinks to partitions, and it would be really hard to delete and recreate the nodes to have the new scheme of WAL.\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nWould it be possible to migrate to the new scheme without deleting the current data? Also I'd like to use the https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/3213 to spread the WALs to several NVME's, again without the need to delete the whole node (those have 8*12 TB drives each, and take forever to backfill)\r\n\r\n**What is use case behind this feature:**\r\nAbove\r\n",
