While it is nice to have the successful logs on occasion, I'm wondering if we can do this so that it's still simple to find the failure logs. Here are a couple different possibilities:\r\n- We could revert #2793 and not worry about the successful logs. Troubleshooting the failures is the critical path for CI.\r\n- We could add a new flag to the CI such as `[all logs]` (similar to `[skip ci]`) such that when specified, the Jenkinsfile would pass an arg or env var to the integration tests that would indicate to collect all logs. \r\n\r\n@leseb @ZYecho thoughts?",
