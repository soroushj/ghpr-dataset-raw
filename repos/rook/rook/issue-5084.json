  "body": "Currently, the rbd-mirror daemon is integrated into the `CephCluster` CRD. This isn't really practical since we would have to wait for the whole orchestration to be done to actually set it up. The same goes for any CR update. Let's say you want to change the number of daemons, Rook would go through mons, mgrs and osds until it get to rbd-mirror. This triggers an undesired full orchestration. With its own CRD this component would gain a lot more flexibility.",
