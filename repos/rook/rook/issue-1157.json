  "body": "Every 5-10 minutes, it is seen in the operator log that the CRDs are triggered for an update by K8s. It is not yet clear why this is, when nothing is happening in the cluster.\r\n\r\nFor the cluster CRD, it is currently a no-op since a cluster update is not implemented. In the log, the message is seen:\r\n```\r\n2017-10-30 11:09:36.540905 I | op-cluster: modifying a cluster not implemented\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor object store, the side effect is more severe. When the update is triggered, the RGW pod is deleted and created again, which will disrupt http requests to the object store for some short time period during the unnecessary restart.\r\n\r\nLooking at the \"old\" and \"new\" objects passed to the update method, I don't see a change in the objects.",
