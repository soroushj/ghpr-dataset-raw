  "body": "Rook currently uses multiple namespaces and service accounts. The rook operator can create and delete namespaces, service accounts, roles and role bindings on the fly. As a result rook requires a *very* privileged service account (see [here](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/cluster/examples/kubernetes/rook-operator.yaml#L9)).\r\n\r\nFor production clusters this not going to work. We need to explore running in a mode where we do not have privileges to destroy the entire cluster. Also creating a deleting namespace is not necessarily something that every cluster-admin is going to want us to do.\r\n\r\nIf a cluster-admin wants to set policies (PSP, SCC, resource quotas, etc.) they need to be able to control which service accounts and namespaces Rook uses. Creating namespaces and service accounts on the fly means that these policies would need to be dynamically applied too.\r\n\r\nThis is a complicated issue but it's one that we should front load. Its come up in the following places #1314 #1337 #1348 #1211 and possible more. Also discussion on twitter here: https://twitter.com/the_sttts/status/945077544587616257\r\n\r\n I'm going to write a design doc and link it here when its ready.",
