For general technical and non-technical questions, we are happy to help you on our [Rook.io Slack](https://Rook-io.slack.com).\r\n3. Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nGiven the dwindling user base on 1.7 especially in the timeframe that Rook 0.9 would be released, there is not a compelling reason to keep supporting 1.7. There is some support/dev cost to maintaining each release. As an example, #1995 would require test code to workaround a feature that is not available in 1.7.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as this change, the pre-req page should be updated with the notes from a recent community discussion on the min version that rook supports.\r\n```\r\nWe are not keeping with the client-go matrix anymore since we don\u2019t support older than 1.7 and that\u2019s OK. Our docs do not state a policy to keep with client-go.  At a minimum, the newest 3-4 versions of k8s should be supported and when we consider dropping a version it needs to be discussed and rationalized for a good reason with expected minimal impact to our users.\r\n```",
