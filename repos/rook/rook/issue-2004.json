  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nThe version of Ceph deployed by the Rook operator should be flexible and specified by the admin in the cluster CRD. This change will allow Rook's version to be independent of the ceph version. \r\n- In production clusters, admins want to very carefully control when they upgrade their ceph clusters since the data path is so critical. \r\n- During development, Rook can be tested against any version of Ceph, whether a stable version of luminous or mimic, or a private dev build.\r\n\r\nThis would require a setting in the cluster CRD, which is the image name of `ceph/ceph` that should be run in the daemon pods (mon, mgr, osd, rgw, mds). \r\n\r\nWith #2003 all the ceph config will be generated by an init container, which means the daemons can be launched with their docker image independent from the rook image.\r\n\r\nThe operator needs to run the Ceph client tools such as `ceph` and `radosgw-admin` to manage the cluster. The client tools are tested by the Ceph team to be backward compatible by two versions. Therefore, the operator can support a version of Ceph up to two versions older than the client tools it contains.\r\n\r\nThe operator will be made to understand differences in the Ceph versions that are necessary for orchestration. For example, if a new daemon were added in Nautilus, the operator would understand to deploy that daemon only if the version is 14 or greater.\r\n\r\nThis design has come up in the discussions around 0.9 feature work where features are actively been developed in the Ceph layer, specifically for integration with the mgr, as well as NFS Ganesha integration.\r\n\r\nA full design document is to follow.",
