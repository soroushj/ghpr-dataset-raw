For general technical and non-technical questions, we are happy to help you on our [Rook.io Slack](https://slack.rook.io/).\r\n3. Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Deviation from expected behavior:**\r\nThe flex driver looks at a mount to know whether to unmount as cephfs or rbd by executing:\r\n```\r\ndf --type ceph <mountDir>\r\n```\r\nIf the command fails, it is assumed to be an rbd volume. The code is seen [here](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/cmd/rookflex/cmd/unmount.go#L54-L58) for the detection of the CephFS mount. \r\n@ajarr Do you have a suggestion on how to detect more reliably that we have a cephfs mount (and not rbd)?\r\n\r\nThis proves to be a problem periodically in the integration tests as seen in [this log](https://jenkins.rook.io/job/rook/job/rook/job/PR-4098/6/artifact/_output/tests/TestCephSmokeSuite_aws_1.12.x_smoke-ns-system_rook-ceph-agent-7v95g_1571171186.log):\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-10-15 20:20:06.371590 I | flexdriver: unmounting mount dir: /var/lib/kubelet/pods/1b0a4e1b-ef89-11e9-ad97-0a634561bf72/volumes/ceph.rook.io~smoke-ns-system/smoke-test-fs\r\n2019-10-15 20:20:06.392301 E | flexdriver: Unmount volume at mount dir /var/lib/kubelet/pods/1b0a4e1b-ef89-11e9-ad97-0a634561bf72/volumes/ceph.rook.io~smoke-ns-system/smoke-test-fs failed: failed to get persistent volume smoke-test-fs: persistentvolumes \"smoke-test-fs\" not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that logging we see the unexpected message that \"failed to get persistent volume\", which is called in unmount.go from GetAttachInfoFromMountDir(), which only happens when the volume is treated as an rbd volume. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe cephfs volumes should be successfully unmounted instead of falling back to the rbd driver.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\nLook at the periodic failures in the integration tests.\r\n",
