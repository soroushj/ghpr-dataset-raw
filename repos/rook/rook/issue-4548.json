  "body": "**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Feature Request\r\n\r\n**What should the feature do:**\r\nThe Rook support policy for k8s versions should be based on the kubernetes support policy as well as the support policies of the cloud providers and major distros. The Kubernetes project maintains release branches for the most recent three minor releases. (https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions). At the time of this writing, the supported Amazon EKS Kubernetes versions are: 1.12.x, 1.13.x, and 1.14.x (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html). Red Hat OpenShift v3.11 based on k8s 1.11 is scheduled to be supported until June 2022 and OCP 4.1 based on k8s 1.13 will likely be supported through March 2020 ((https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift).\r\n\r\nIntermediate k8s versions that are no longer supported by cloud providers and major distros need not be supported by Rook. For example, k8s 1.12 may no longer be supported by any cloud providers and major distros in the Rook 1.3 time frame. If that is the case, then Rook 1.3 need not waste resources testing against k8s 1.12. At some point during each Rook release cycle, the current k8s support landscape should be assessed and the list of supported k8s versions should be defined for the upcoming release.",
