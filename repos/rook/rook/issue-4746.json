  "body": "During my last kubespray and rook deployment, I ran into a `no volume plugin matched` error. I found #4438, thinking it was the same as my issue, and pitched in my setup and logs.\r\n\r\nI later identified that kubespray had changed its flexvolume plugin dir since the time the documentation was written, therefore I had mistakenly instructed rook to use a custom flexvolume plugin dir.\r\n\r\nI am no longer sure if it is the same problem as the others reported in that issue, so I am starting a new issue specifically for the documentation updates I think are needed in order to make that page make more sense to someone like me.\r\n\r\nOpening a PR to fix shortly.\r\n\r\n@galexrt",
