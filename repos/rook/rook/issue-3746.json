When generated in place it causes the file to remain checked out. Developers unexpectedly see the diff in their local changes and the CI reports the build with a `dirty` suffix since a file remains checked out in the enlistment. This was overlooked in #3701. \r\n\r\n@k0da Either we will need to revert #3701 or generate the values.yaml to another file that is ignored or in a temp build directory. Can you take a look?\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nFiles in the enlistment should not be modified in the build.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\n- Build Rook\r\n- See values.yaml modified in the enlistment\r\n",
