  "body": "So you can target v0.5@HEAD but still provide v0.4.x versions easily.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be beneficial to lock the versions in the yaml files to the latest of the given branch, so that \r\n```console\r\n$ curl -sSL kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/release-0.4/demo/kubernetes/rook-operator.yaml\r\n```\r\nwould return `quay.io/rook/rookd:v0.4.x` in the image field. Before every new patch release these numbers would be bumped to `v0.4.x+1`. At master, the tag would always be `master-latest`\r\n\r\n@bassam ^",
