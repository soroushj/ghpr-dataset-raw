The `--log-to-stderr` flag is missing to the OSD daemon. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe OSD daemon should have the flags for enabling logging to stderr. All other daemons enable the flags by calling [DefaultFlags()](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/pkg/operator/ceph/config/defaults.go#L27), but these flags are missing for the OSDs.\r\n@BlaineEXE @leseb Do you recall if there was a reason the OSDs were not configured with the default flags used by other daemons?\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\n- Create a cluster\r\n- Examine the OSD pod logs and see they are very empty\r\n- Examine the OSD pod spec and see that `--log-to-stderr` and other default flags are missing\r\n",
