For general technical and non-technical questions, we are happy to help you on our [Rook.io Slack](https://slack.rook.io/).\r\n3. Did you already search the existing open issues for anything similar? -->\r\n\r\n**Is this a bug report or feature request?**\r\n* Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Deviation from expected behavior:**\r\nIn a small cluster such as 3 OSDs, the default PG count `mon_max_pg_per_osd` is very limiting for clusters since the default PG count changed from 8 to 32 in v14.2.8. Now all you have to do is create an object store and one block pool before you hit the pool limit when replicas.size is 3 for all the pools (the recommended default). \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, the max PGs per OSD (default is 250) can be increased from the toolbox with the following command:\r\n```\r\nceph config set mon mon_max_pg_per_osd 500\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Rook users would like to avoid PG management to keep things simple, especially in common scenarios. \r\n\r\n@jdurgin What is your recommendation on how to deal with the new default. Increasing the max PGs per OSD seems like a temporary fix rather than a good recommendation.\r\n \r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nRook users should be able to create several pools, object stores, and filesystems on a basic cluster (3 OSDs) before hitting limits.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (minimal and precise):**\r\n<!-- Please let us know any circumstances for reproduction of your bug. -->\r\n- Create a cluster on v14.2.8 or newer\r\n- `kubectl create -f pool.yaml`\r\n- `kubectl create -f object.yaml`\r\n\r\nThe object store will fail to be configured and rgw daemons will not start due to errors with pool creation.",
