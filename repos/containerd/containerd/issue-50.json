  "body": "This is re: additional suggestions for https://github.com/docker/containerd/pull/48 - I wanted to send one or two in smaller CLs to give you a little flavor of what I'm talking about.\n\nOverall, I would think to use the messages in api/types as the base data type for supervisor. Using protobuf generated messages as DTOs is a general big win for consistency, and it forces a programming style that can lead to less bugs down the road. As an example here, instead of having `type EventType string`, we've used protobuf to generate an `int32` enum for us. By being an int instead of a string, developers are almost forced to use actual enum const values as opposed to freeform strings, the latter of which can lead to types in the codebase that are not tracked as consts (https://github.com/docker/containerd/blob/1d63236c2711e1f9567792daa9f81f263229075c/api/grpc/server/server.go#L234 and https://github.com/docker/containerd/blob/1d63236c2711e1f9567792daa9f81f263229075c/api/grpc/server/server.go#L241).\n\nLet me know what you think.\n",
