Since the number of namespaces should be relatively low, and we don't need to encode much information in them (we have labels).\r\n\r\nI propose we restrict them to DNS labels. See https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt for details of that character set, but it is letters, digits and `-`.\r\n\r\ncc @Random-Liu ",
