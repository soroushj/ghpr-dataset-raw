Inside there are some named pipes for stdin, stdout and stderr.\r\n\r\nIf you start a lot of process /tmp can easily be full with these files and the system can be unstable. I'm trying to find a workaround to delete these from my scripts, but I can't be sure which directory is created by which process.\r\n\r\nI have \"ctr version 0.2.2 commit: v0.2.2\".",
