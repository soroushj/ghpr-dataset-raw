  "body": "Now it probably doesn't come as a surprise, but I'm not the biggest fan of the shim.  I (think I) know it's technical purpose, but have use cases where I'd rather not run it.  From what I know the shim serves two purposes.  1) detach and reattach to I/O  2) record the exit status.  I'd like it if the shim was optional.  If I don't need those capabilities it shouldn't be launched (opt out in the API somehow).  So I was thinking about that and considering that maybe `Create` shouldn't be an API of the shim.  That `Create` should just be forking the shim.  The reason I say that is somewhere in containerd when it starts the container it will need to start the shim and then use gprc API to create the process.  Same with exec.  If the shim was optional them you'd have to have two code flows for the create, start, and exec and probably others.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would make more sense if the shim was just a runc wrapper so that `shim create/start/exec` had the same invocation pattern as `runc create/start/exec`.  Then the grpc API would only be used to access the capabilities that the shim provides (mainly the interacting with I/O).\r\n\r\nOr not :)  I don't care about the design, just if the shim was optional that would be great.",
