  "body": "**What is the problem you're trying to solve**\r\nWe have encountered issues with containers that end up doing a lot of disk i/o on the overlayfs (instead of using a proper mount via a k8s emptyDir etc) and end up starving containerd leading to timeouts on various CRI operations. For things like k8s emptyDirs, we have been able to isolate containerd by keeping the containerd root location on a different drive than the kubelet but since the overlayfs directory is hardcoded to be under the containerd root, we are unable to do so in that case.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAllowing the location of the overlayfs to be configured when configuring the overlayfs plugin would help provide the flexibility to do so if the operator wants to.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",
