  "body": "Not a big deal for this project right now, but I hit a few oddities with Go 1.12 in other projects and had to dig into linter issues. Seems like gometalinter is EOL soon.\r\n\r\n> The gometalinter GitHub project will be archived on 2019-04-07. Releases will still be available for download but no further code will be committed and issues will be read-only.\r\n> \r\n> Switch to [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).\r\n> \r\n> Many thanks to all contributors, in particular dnephin who has helped me maintain gometalinter for the last year or two.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter/issues/590",
