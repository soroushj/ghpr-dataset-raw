  "body": "Support for download resumption was an initial goal in containerd's design and much of the plumbing already existed. This pull request contains changes to ensure that this functionality is activated correctly when downloading images via the Docker Registry HTTP API V2.\r\n\r\nThis required a few fixes to ensure the content store was operating correctly when a download is resumed. We now have proper tests for this that validate it works against the local content store and over the service API.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a seekable http reader was implemented to launch requests at the correct offset when a reader is seeked in `content.Copy`.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Stephen J Day <stephen.day@docker.com>\r\n\r\nCloses #1526",
