  "body": "The [`go build`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies) command by default discards all built package dependencies for the current target. In a development iteration where `containerd` is modified and rebuilt many times this means that all the packages are rebuilt, whether they were modified or not.\r\n\r\nThe `-i` option allows to install built packages that were dependencies of the target (in the `pkg` subdir) for later reuse (similar to [`go install`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies) ), resulting in a process similar to an incremental build. With the current `go` version (`go1.9.2`) the `-i` option results in a significant speed improvement when calling [`make binaries`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.0.0/Makefile#L137).\r\n\r\nThe downside is that several MB are left in `pkg`, that's why I'm raising an issue to discuss it instead of just submitting a PR (and because there may be another drawbacks or design decisions I'm not aware of).\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to introduce another option (maybe as a environment variable) to the [Makefile](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.0.0/Makefile#L140) that would cause it to call `go build` with the *install compiled dependencies* option `-i`.\r\n\r\nFor further reading about the difference between `go build` and `go install` there is a simple and illustrative example [here](https://github.com/NanXiao/golang-101-hacks/blob/master/posts/go-build-vs-go-install.md).\r\n",
