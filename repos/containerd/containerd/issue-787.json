  "body": "The previous version of containerd has support for the checkpoint & restore feature exposed by runc (and implemented with CRIU). This is used in Docker currently as well (as an experimental feature). The 1.0 rewrite of containerd should also support this feature.\r\n\r\nBased on actual usage and feedback we've gotten so far, there's been some discussion about reworking the interface. Right now, checkpoints are \"attached\" to containers, but I think it makes more sense to move towards checkpoints being a more global resource. \r\n\r\nThere also wasn't much thought put into how the filesystem side of things should be managed. One of the biggest use cases for C/R is container migration, so it would be nice to have a more integrated way to manage all the checkpoint related metadata that can be used to move the data around to different machines.\r\n\r\nI'd love to get some feedback from others about how this should work before sitting down and trying to implement anything.\r\n\r\n/cc @xemul @avagin @crosbymichael ",
