  "body": "This PR sketches out the correct approach to get attach over ssh working. The ssh server portion is fairly complete and tested as part of another project. The PTY handling code and IO creation code and more theoretical.\n\nI have to move on to other work. I am hoping someone can work from this to get attach working with very little effort. It should be a matter of exporting the correct IO representation over the Event bus and then connecting the streams.\n\nPlease let me know if you have questions.\n\ncc @crosbymichael \n",
