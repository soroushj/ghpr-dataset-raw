  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWhen working to embed containerd as demonstrated in the initial post in #1615, the dependency resolution (admittedly, using `dep`) resolved v1.2.0-rc2 as the latest possible version. After further investigation this is due to the following import statement in `services/server/server_solaris.go`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n       srvconfig \"github.com/containerd/containerd/server/config\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should be:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n       srvconfig \"github.com/containerd/containerd/services/server/config\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current statement is missing `services/`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n1. Attempt to vendor a dependency including `containerd/services/server`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you received:**\r\nVersion 1.2.0-rc2 is the latest whose imports can all be resolved.\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you expected:**\r\nResolution to a newer v1.2.x tag (eg. 1.2.6).\r\n\r\n**Output of `containerd --version`:**\r\nN/A - introduced in commit 06616dab0055b5762ecae348374582120df9049a\r\n\r\nI'm submitting a PR to fix this and one other small issue I noticed.\r\n",
