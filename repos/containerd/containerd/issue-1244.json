This is confusing terminology, we should refer to a rootfs as either a set of mounts to create a rootfs or a directory which can be used as a rootfs. In the client we should use the term snapshots to refer to any identifier which is to be used with a snapshotter.\r\n\r\nNaming might look like...\r\n - `WithSnapshot` - would take in existing snapshot\r\n - `WithNewSnapshot` - formerly `WithNewRootFS` (could also be called `WithNewActiveSnapshot`?)\r\n - `WithNewSnapshotView` - formerly `WithNewReadonlyRootFS`\r\n - `WithRootFS` - would take in mounts and use them directly\r\n - `WithRootFSPath` - would take in local directory to bind mount as rootfs",
