  "body": "I apologize if this is not the best channel for this but I think it would be good to clarify in the README, or somewhere else, what exactly is the `*.pb.txt` format in the `api/` folder.\r\n\r\nIt states that it is inline version of the API, frozen in time for a specific release. It doesn't state where that format comes from and whether its a standard or something custom. It looks like `protobuild` generates it but there isn't any mention of the format in that project's documentation either.\r\n\r\nIf it's not a standard, having a specification of the format would be helpful. Specifically, it's important that anyone trying to develop a client for the API in another language is able to consume that format.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is not the appropriate place to discuss this, and how to proceed if that's the case. Thank you!",
