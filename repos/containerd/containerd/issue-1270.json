  "body": "At this point, the `Makefile` is becoming littered with terse inlines and hacks to support multi-platform behavior. Let's move to having a platform include file per platform to separate out the platform-specific behavior. We would add something like this to the base `Makefile`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninclude Makefile.${GOOS}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the file doesn't exist, we get a build error. If it does exist, it can set platform-specific items, such as the WHALE, package lists and other branched behavior.\r\n\r\nThis will keep our `Makefile` clean, simple and readable. The platform-specific items will be neatly hidden away, where they belong.",
