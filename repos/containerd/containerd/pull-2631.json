  "body": "Closes #2606\r\n\r\nWhen waiting for a golang cmd to exit, golang will block exiting on all of its process streams being closed. Currently, the containerd server is configuring each shim processes output (stdout/stderr) to redirect to the server\u2019s stdout/stderr. When running the containerd restart tests, these do not get closed - and waiting for the server process to finish hangs.\r\nSince restarting the containerd server does not restart the shim processes, the shims output streams *could* still be outputting logs, never to be closed. The aim of this PR is to let the shim instead log to named pipes.\r\n\r\n* When a new task is created, the server:\r\n * creates a new named pipe (one for stdout and one for stderr).\r\n * assigns the start shim command stdout/err to the write ends of these pipes\r\n * schedules a go routine to copy from the pipes\u2019 read end to os.Stdout/os.Stderr, thus capturing the shim\u2019s logs\r\n* When the shim process starts it opens the stout and stderr pipes in read-only mode in order to keep the pipes open even if the server process goes down\r\n * Note that the shim process never reads from the pipes, it just keeps them open\r\n* When a containerd server comes back and restores its tasks:\r\n * it opens the pipes that have been already created\r\n * is schedules a goroutine to copy the pipes contents to os.Stdout/os.Stderr, thus capturing the logs of an already running shim processes\r\n* When shim debugging is off shim processes stdout/stderr are set to `nil` i.e. the server does not capture shim logs\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to test the change we:\r\n* Enabled shim debugging for all tests as the containerd server lifecycle and its settings are managed globally in `TestMain`\r\n* In order to be able to verify that the server connects to existing shim processes stdio we had to make the server output available to tests. Initially we attempted to read from the stdio buffer from the test but because the buffer is shared accross all parallel tests we go a d\r\nata race. Therefore we sent the server output to a temporary file which tests can use to check the output without data races.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe noticed that there is something similar implemented for v2, however we do not really understand how to use and run tests against it. It seems in v2, it creates a single pipe for both stdout and stderr rather than one for each stream and the server does not reconnect to those pipes when restoring running tasks. We could fix it for v2 if we knew how!\r\n\r\ncc @ostenbom",
