Start a container\r\n2. Kill containerd\r\n3. Kill the container process\r\n4. Start containerd again\r\n\r\nYou will see logs from the shim saying that it can't send the event due to context cancelled.\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you received:**\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime=\"2020-07-17T23:55:43.878255535Z\" level=error msg=\"forward event\" error=\"context canceled\"\r\ntime=\"2020-07-17T23:55:49.879116394Z\" level=error msg=\"evicting /tasks/exit from queue because of retry count\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you expected:**\r\n\r\nEvent should be able to send.\r\n\r\n**Output of `containerd --version`:**\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontainerd github.com/containerd/containerd v1.4.0-beta.2-17-g4feb8c46.m 4feb8c462393ce6834dda9e3464c4fee8ee73232.m\r\n```",
