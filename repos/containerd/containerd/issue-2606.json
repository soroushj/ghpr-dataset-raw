  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWhile running containerd tests we wanted to capture the `containerd-shim` output to figure out how shim works. We found out that when doing so the tests started to hang when test runner waits for the containerd [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/daemon_test.go#L117) (you can easily reproduce it via running `TestDaemonRestart`)\r\n\r\nIt turned out that tests hang while trying to `Wait` for the `containerd` daemon to stop/restart. This is due to the implementation of [`(*Cmd).Wait`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/os/exec/exec.go#L439) in the Go standard library, which will _\"wait for any copying to stdin or copying from stdout or stderr to complete\"_.\r\n\r\nEnabling the `plugin.linux/shim_debug` flag in the `containerd` configuration will make it [wire the shim's stdout and stderr to the system ones](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/runtime/v1/shim/client/client.go#L140). \r\n\r\nGiven the shim is designed to survive the killing of the server, we believe the following is happening:\r\n\r\n* the tests try to kill the `containerd` daemon;\r\n* the deamon dies, but the shim survives;\r\n* the tests hang while waiting for the shim's stdout/stderr to be flushed.\r\n\r\nWe have confirmed that `kill -9`ing the shim unlocks the tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate the issue we have updated the `TestDaemonRestart` test in a [containerd fork](https://github.com/gcapizzi/containerd/commit/629754283a6087094296192c8117ccc0a1a40de3). After killing the shim process there is a containerd leftovers which one can clean up using this [cleanup script](https://github.com/gcapizzi/containerd/commit/3723cd6dbf34e21f7f52a901408834812006e121)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/gcapizzi/containerd\r\n2. Run the test - `sudo -E go test -run \"TestDaemonRestart\\b\" -test.root=true`\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you received:**\r\nTest times out\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you expected:**\r\nTest passes\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output of `containerd --version`:**\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontainerd github.com/containerd/containerd v1.2.0-beta.2-27-gacced5d5.m acced5d58f61f342ef012643d6c5d6405f709f26.m\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @gcapizzi\r\n",
