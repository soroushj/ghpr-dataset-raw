  "body": "Sometimes we need to delete a exec process when it's in created state, e.g. doing cleanup when start fails for some reason.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently there is no way to delete a exec process in created state.\r\n\r\n* If you use `process.Delete(ctx)`, it will tell you `process must be stopped before deletion`.\r\n* Even if you `Kill` the process, because the pid is 0, it will return directly and the process will still be `created`.\r\n* If you use `process.Delete(ctx, containerd.WithProcessKill)`, because the process is in created state, `Wait` will start waiting for `TaskExit` event. However, because there is no such event generated, it will hang forever until context deadline exceeded.",
