  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nPlugin registration does not enforce uniqueness of plugin IDs. This leads to an issue when attempting to disable plugins because when `plugin.Graph` loops through the registered plugins to match against the disabled list, it only removes the first plugin with a given ID (presumably on the assumption of uniqueness of plugin IDs).\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue to:\r\n1. have a place to discuss whether or not uniqueness should be enforced in code rather than by convention and\r\n1. to propose addressing the one occurrence of duplicate plugin names I'm aware of -- the `GRPCPlugin` and `ContentPlugin` both named \"content\".\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n1. List `\"content\"` in the `disabled_plugins` slice in the containerd config file\r\n2. Start and stop containerd a few times. Observe that because of registration order, it is not deterministic which of the plugins get disabled.\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you received:**\r\nIt is not possible to disable a specific one of either the `GRPCPlugin` or `ContentPlugin` named \"content\" reliably.\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you expected:**\r\nDisabling a plugin by providing it's ID in the config file.\r\n\r\n**Output of `containerd --version`:**\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontainerd github.com/containerd/containerd v1.2.0-473-g5f4c977b 5f4c977ba0c44d6e12a0907251ca133954f0c82d\r\n```\r\n",
