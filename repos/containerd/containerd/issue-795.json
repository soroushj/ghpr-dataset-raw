  "body": "On some platform the pid returned by the execution runtime may not match a pid on the host (this is actually the case on the windows implementation at the moment).\r\n\r\nAs such, we should add a `pid` field to the `KillRequest`. This will also allow for client to signal previously created `Execs`.\r\n\r\nI guess we could use `oneof` to have either `all` or `pid` set within `KillRequest`.\r\n\r\nThinking of it, maybe the rpc should be renamed to `SignalProcess`?\r\n",
