  "body": "When using `unix.Kill()` to kill a process, you know whether a process already exited or not by checking whether the returned error is `syscall.ESRCH`.\r\n\r\n* Current behavior of containerd `Kill` api:\r\nIf we `Kill` a container twice in a short period (e.g. first for graceful deletion, second for sigkill), the second one may get `\"os: process already finished\"`, which the caller doesn't know whether it should ignore or not.\r\n* Expected behavior:\r\nIf we `Kill` a container/process which has exited, a known error should be returned, so that the caller knows whether it should ignore the error or not.\r\n\r\nNow we could work around this by parsing the error string and look for `os: process already finished`, which is hacky and platform specific. File the issue here so that we could handle this more properly.",
