  "body": "Snapshots, unlike content do not support using labels to link one item to multiple snapshots. The current edges are defined in #1398.  This is a proposal to update the parsing of the snapshots label to support multiple links.\r\n\r\nAn example of this label would look like...\r\n`containerd.io/gc.ref.snapshot.overlay/1`\r\n\r\nI am proposing using a `/` rather than `.` here to preserve `.` to be used in snapshotter names. Using a `/` is already considered invalid for snapshotter names since they are used in directory names. It might be worth considering also updating the content labels to also support `/` for consistency.",
