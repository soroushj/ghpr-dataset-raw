  "body": "Currently, the event code has a duplicated `Event` type defined that slightly differs from the one used by the grpc api: it has `Status int` instead of `Status uint32`\n\nWe should sync the 2 structs to avoid  `-1` values becoming `4294967295`\n\nUsing `types.Event` directly is a bit annoying giving that it is using a `protobuf.timestamp` type. This would require extra conversion that could possibly fail. Atm this conversion is only needed in one place. \n",
