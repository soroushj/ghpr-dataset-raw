  "body": "Please see #1709 for context.\r\n\r\nThe PR above allowed namespaces to share content easily, reducing overall bandwidth. It had a configuration option to use an \"isolated\" content sharing policy. If we find this useful in the future, we may want to include this option in a future release.\r\n\r\nThe documentation describes roughly how the feature would work:\r\n\r\n### Bolt Metadata Plugin\r\n \r\nThe bolt metadata plugin allows configuration of the content sharing policy between namespaces.\r\n \r\nThe default mode \"shared\" will make blobs available in all namespaces once it is pulled into any namespace.\r\nThe blob will be pulled into the namespace if a writer is opened with the \"Expected\" digest that is already present in the backend.\r\n \r\nThe alternative mode, \"isolated\" requires that clients prove they have access to the content by providing all of the content to the ingest before the blob is added to the namespace.\r\n \r\nBoth modes share backing data, while \"shared\" will reduce total bandwidth across namespaces, at the cost of allowing access to any blob just by knowing its digest.\r\n\r\nThe default is \"shared\". While this is largely the most desired policy, one can change to \"isolated\" mode with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n [plugins.bolt]\r\n \tcontent_sharing_policy = \"isolated\"\r\n ```",
