  "body": "I noticed that in 4.4.5 spec defines as TARGETPATH:\r\n\r\n> Each key of the TARGETS object is a TARGETPATH. A TARGETPATH is a path to a file that is relative to a mirror's base URL of targets. It should not have a leading path separator to avoid surprising behavior when constructing paths on disk.\r\n\r\nPresumably this should be `/`, it says it's a file relative to the URL, and URLs use that as the path separator, but it'd be helpful if this was explicit.\r\n\r\nThis is relevant because in rust-tuf, we have a [PathTranslator](https://github.com/heartsucker/rust-tuf/blob/develop/src/client.rs#L87) in order to use alternative path separators to support converting `/` to `\\` on windows, but I'm pretty sure this logic really should be moved to our FileSystemRepository.",
