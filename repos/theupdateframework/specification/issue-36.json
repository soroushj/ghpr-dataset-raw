  "body": "The spec defines the `spec_version\"` as:\r\n\r\n> SPEC_VERSION is the version number of the specification. Metadata is written according to version \"spec_version\" of the specification, and clients MUST verify that \"spec_version\" matches the expected version number. Adopters are free to determine what is considered a match (e.g., the version number exactly, or perhaps only the major version number (major.minor.fix).\r\n\r\nTwo requests:\r\n* The document implies that `spec_version` is a string. Could this be explicitly mentioned?\r\n* The document does not describe the format of the `spec_version` string. Can it contain arbitrary values, or is it only to be [semver](https://semver.org/) compatible?\r\n\r\nWould it be acceptable to submit PRs to change the spec, or would these changes need to go through TAPs first?",
