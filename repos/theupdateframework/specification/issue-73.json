  "body": "We would like to make it possible to make changes to the TUF specification in a way that:\r\n\r\n1. makes it easy to timestamp and archive versions of the TUF specification in semver style\r\n\r\n1. enables there to be working drafts of new TUF versions.  In particular, changes that are backwards incompatible (major), backwards compatible (minor), and typo fixes (patch) in parallel.  \r\n\r\n1. the manual effort to keep everything consistent is minimized.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, I propose that there are three different \"living\" documents for the TUF spec (major-draft, minor-draft, and latest) that are edited in a very specific way.  To provide a conceptual model that is easy to understand, the documents form a hierarchy, major (backwards-incompatible) -> minor (backwards compatible) -> patch (typo fixes).  To minimize manual effort, changes in the document are only made to the drafts that need to be changed.  To achieve this, all changes to lower documents propagate to higher documents.  For example, if a typo is fixed in a patch, both the minor and major draft versions are updated to fix the typo.  If a backwards incompatible change is made to the specification, only the major document changes.  \r\n\r\nUsing such a hierarchy, it requires little effort to apply the correct semver number to a new release of TUF.  Simply take the prior version and increment the version number that applies to the appropriate patch, while zeroing out all lower version numbers.  For example, when at version 2.4.3 of the specification and accepting a minor draft, the new version number is 2.5.0.  In all cases, the newly approved draft becomes the latest.  If the major draft is accepted, then the previous major draft also becomes the new minor-draft and latest.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not handle the question of when to release a new version of the specification.  A new version of the specification is released in two scenarios.  First, whenever a patch change is accepted, the specification number is released.  Second, when there is consensus in the community that a specific minor version or major version is ready, this is accepted and finalized.  ",
