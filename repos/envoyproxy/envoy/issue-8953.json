  "body": "Today, the `RouteAction` proto contains a `oneof` that provides [3 different ways to select the cluster](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/6e5cf6fb3e7578931028327be2e039322fa7c1e6/api/envoy/api/v2/route/route.proto#L660):\r\n\r\n- hard-coded cluster name\r\n- header from which to read the cluster name\r\n- the WeightedClusters mechanism\r\n\r\nWe would like to write an HTTP filter that can override the cluster chosen for a given route, which basically means that we are not using any of the 3 mechanisms currently supported.  My initial thought was that we should add a 4th option to this `oneof` to indicate that the cluster will be chosen by a filter.\r\n\r\nAfter discussion with @mattklein123 and @htuch, our consensus is that a more general way to do this would be to provide a generic way for a filter to overwrite any part of the `RouteAction` proto, not just the choice of cluster.  This would address not just my immediate use-case but also the more general problem of allowing filters to have more control over routing decisions.\r\n\r\nThis more general approach could be configured via an `Any` field, either within the `RouteAction` proto or as a sibling of the `RouteAction` proto within the `Route` proto.",
