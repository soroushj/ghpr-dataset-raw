  "body": "I was running into weird time behaviour as I was trying to add more integration test coverage for drain closing behaviour. I took out the simulated time, took out the WIP changes in review, and isolated it to just the drain timeout plumbing on the original protocol integration test.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/auni53/envoy/pull/3\r\n\r\nThe first comment is a \"good run\", `drain_time_ = std::chrono::seconds(1);`, with trace comments enabled. the second comment has `drain_time_ = std::chrono::seconds(10)` and hangs infinitely on the stat flushing loop. I'm not really familiar enough with the shutdown sequence to understand what's not being triggered. I got tsan to find some errors yesterday but can't seem to be able to re-trigger that.",
