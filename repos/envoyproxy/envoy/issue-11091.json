  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nAs downstream consumers of envoy binary, we would like to find a process to discover and bump the envoy binary when a new version of a given minor has been released. \r\n\r\n### Facts\r\n\r\nI see that in #10800 the community has stopped publishing `latest` tag for envoy docker image and I found the following [Stable release of Envoy doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFYR1b_n6Qz0caZmMqm008CKG7Q5eM5pXWPu0pAtGmw/edit#heading=h.xw1gqgyqs5b) that describes the release schedule for a given minor version.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nWhile it's technically possible to consume/watch the latest github release for enovy, extract the version info, and `docker pull` the given tag, there are a few downsides to this approach:\r\n1. There is no guarantee that the docker image has been pushed to dockerhub when the release is made\r\n1. All downstream consumers have to re-invent the same process in order to get the latest patched version of an envoy binary\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n1. Would it be possible to have the downstream users consume a `1.minor.x` (e.g. 1.14.x) docker image tag in order to get the latest patched envoy binary for a given minor?\r\n1. Is there a better workflow for consuming the latest patched envoy binary other than the docker image? We currently use the following docker image: `envoyproxy/envoy`",
