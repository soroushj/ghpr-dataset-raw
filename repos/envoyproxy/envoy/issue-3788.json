  "body": "Currently when Envoy receives a h/2 response with Connection specific headers (like `keep-alive`) it will fail with: `Invalid HTTP header field was received`\r\n\r\nThis is due to [nghttp explicitly disallowing these headers](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/blob/842509dab604e6cc62f7fb98d448294c6ec85763/lib/nghttp2_http.c#L206). This is in accordance with the h/2 spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.2 , which states that these headers should not be present in h/2 messages.\r\n\r\nIt seems like Envoy should be stripping these headers when converting a h/1.1 response into a h/2 response, or maybe just blindly strip these for h/2 given that they'll cause a protocol error downstream.
