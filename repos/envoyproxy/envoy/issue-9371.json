  "body": "For some of our thrift clusters, we'd like to use HTTP health checks over the same port used for thrift/data connections.\r\n\r\nWe could do this using `FilterChainMatch`'s `application_protocols` field for matching. But for this to work, we'd need to either 1) be able to configure the ALPN on health checks or 2) be able to set ALPN from thrift proxy (doing this via `CommonTlsContext` is no good because it'd be used for both HCs and data requests).\r\n\r\nI think I prefer 1). Does it sound reasonable to add an `alpn_protocol` field to the `HealthCheck` message? If so, I'll send in a PR. \r\n\r\ncc: @zuercher @mattklein123 @fishcakez\r\ncc: @htuch for API ergonomics. \r\n",
