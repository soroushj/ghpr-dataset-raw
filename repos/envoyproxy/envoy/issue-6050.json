  "body": "We are using x-request-id header for distibuted logging in the backend powered with istio. \r\n\r\nNow request id is generated on the server side (envoy edge server) and returned to client as a response header. We are using request id reported from clients for issues tracking.\r\n\r\nThe problem is - we are unable to trace timed out request.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue we want to generate request id on the client side, but envoy sanitizes this header and replaces it. There are several solutions like using own custom header beside istio-generated x-request-id, however maintaining several ids does not seem the right way.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to make headers sanitizing configurable or remove x-request-id sanitizing with proper validation for it to be a valid UUID?",
