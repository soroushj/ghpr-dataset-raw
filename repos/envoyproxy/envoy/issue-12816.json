  "body": "### Intro\r\n\r\nOne of the first operations  Envoy's fault filter performs when it receives an incoming network request is [checking for whether the maximum number of active faults has been reached or not](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/extensions/filters/http/fault/fault_filter.cc#L121). If the number of currently active faults is greater than agreed on maximum limit, [Envoy increments `faults_overflow` counter](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/extensions/filters/http/fault/fault_filter.cc#L216) which is supposed to help its users to understand when too many flows are flowing into the system.\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nEnvoy increases the value of `faults_overflow` counter without checking whether an incoming requests \"contains\" a fault or not. This results in `faults_overflow` metric being inaccurate. Whether `faults_overflow` metrics is incremented or not for cases when fault filter is serving the maximum number of faults, should depend on whether Envoy was instructed to inject a fault into a given incoming network request - the one being processed at the moment. If there is no fault to inject, the `faults_overflow` metric should not be incremented even if the number of `active_faults` is at its maximum value.",
