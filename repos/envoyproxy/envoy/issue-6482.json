  "body": "We've had several production issues caused by a client setting an invalid Envoy header, for example `\"200.0\"` as a timeout or an extra space in an `x-envoy-retry-on` header). Right now Envoy just silently ignores invalid header values. It would help avoid these situations if Envoy had a \"strict header validation\" option where it either fails every request which has an invalid Envoy header or logs an error.\r\n\r\nthoughts on whether this would be straightforward / reasonable to implement? It seems like it would be tricky to implement strict validation for every single header but even having it for just a few headers would be helpful. ",
