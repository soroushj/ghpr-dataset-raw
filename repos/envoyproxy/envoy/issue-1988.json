  "body": "**Issue Template**\r\n\r\n*Title*: Push semantics in ADS/xDS\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\nSeems that the aggressive EDS/RDS request behavior makes it hard to implement a stateless management server.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Envoy requests EDS aggressively. As soon as it receives a response, it makes another request. For a server that's trying to push an EDS update, this creates a lot of complexity. First, the server needs to leave one of the requests open (otherwise, Envoy spins forever). That means it needs to know that all resources made it through EDS. Unfortunately, Envoy only accepts resources that have been asked as `resource_name` in EDS request. In case that Envoy requests resources one by one, the server now needs to track how many resources have already been acknowledged by the remote Envoy node. That information will have to be embedded in the version or be tracked in some shared cache between management server instances. This tracking per node/resource requires some state and prevents writing a stateless push server.\r\n\r\ncc @htuch @mattklein123 \r\n\r\n",
