  "body": "*Title*: Endpoint HealthStatus has to be delivered via EDS, it is ignored when delivered via CDS' LoadAssignment or via static config file\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\nNot sure if this is a bug or a feature, but I tried adding unhealthy endpoints delivered via CDS with Type: STATIC & LoadAssignment populated it ignored the HealthStatus flag at the endpoints, it always set them to HEALTHY even though I could definitely see (via `grpcurl`) that they were set to UNHEALTHY in the protos. Same thing happens when it is set via static config JSON. The docs say that it can be delivered via EDS but it sounds like any way should work as it is mostly just decomposing protobufs?\r\nOr is it an intended feature?\r\n\r\nSample from the config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic_resources:\r\n  clusters:\r\n  - connectTimeout: 0.800s\r\n    commonLbConfig:\r\n      healthy_panic_threshold:\r\n        value: 1.0\r\n    loadAssignment:\r\n      clusterName: default-test-locality\r\n      endpoints:\r\n      - lbEndpoints:\r\n        - endpoint:\r\n            address:\r\n              socketAddress:\r\n                address: 10.1.2.3\r\n                portValue: 9999\r\n          health_status: UNHEALTHY\r\n```\r\n(and equivalent from CDS) which produced a ::healthy in the clusters overview and it kept passing traffic there.",
