I didn't test this for cold starts -- though it might be an issue there too.\r\n\r\nI think we should either:\r\n\r\na) not activate HCs until the needed secrets are available\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nb) document the async nature of SDS and how setting `initial_jitter` might be necessary to workaround a race between the first HCs and secrets becoming available (we could add this to https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/docs/root/intro/arch_overview/operations/init.rst\r\n)\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\ncc: @mattklein123 @fishcakez ",
