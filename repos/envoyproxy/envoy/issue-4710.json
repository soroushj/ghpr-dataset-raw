  "body": "Today, we use proto namespaces to express versioning, with `v2alpha` reserved for experimental protos and `v2` for stable.\r\n\r\nBy \"stable\", we mean that protos are subject to the normal restrictions on wire-level backwards compatibility for proto, see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/api/STYLE.md, and that any field removal or semantic change is subject to Envoy's breaking change policy, see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master//CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-change-policy.\r\n\r\nSo far, most field removals have been done in support of alternative API features with supersets of removed functionality. This allows config translators in xDS generation pipelines to continue to function. \r\n\r\nThere are two problems we have with the above:\r\n1. There is no stated API guarantee that we won't remove support for features at the semantic level across Envoy releases. This means that if Envoy consumer X offers feature A in their own APIs to their customers with a guarantee of N years support, and Envoy turns down A in a 3 month cycle deprecation cycle, then the Envoy consumer can't offer its stronger API guarantees to its customers.\r\n2. It's difficult to reason about API status based on Envoy release version, since this is not expressed directly in the protos or wire format.\r\n\r\nI think we should have a stronger policy statement for (1), e.g. \"you can only remove in favor of superset capabilities that can be mechanically translated to\" and for (2) start to make use of `.v3` or `.v2.1` etc. to version at proto level.",
