  "body": "While we now have explicit extension [security postures](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/f1c0031819ddc7b8a9f6352ad6722f4abf8ab664/bazel/envoy_library.bzl#L37), there is no systematic way to govern how extensions are promoted from untrusted to trusted, i.e. when they are considered robust to downstream or upstream; we generally rely on Envoy maintainer intuition and burn time. We should probably have a checklist providing _guidelines_ on how this can be done in a consistent way.\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n* Does the extension have fuzz coverage? If it's only receiving fuzzing courtesy of the generic listener/network/HTTP filter fuzzers, does it have a dedicated fuzzer for any parts of the code that would benefit?\r\n* Does the extension have unbounded internal buffering? Does it participate in flow control via watermarking as needed?\r\n* Does the extension have at least one deployment with live untrusted traffic for a period of time, N months?\r\n* Does the extension rely on dependencies that meet our [extension maturity model](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/10471)?\r\n* Is the extension reasonable to audit by Envoy security team for obvious scary things, e.g. `memcpy`, does it have gnarly parsing code, etc?\r\n* Does the extension have active `CODEOWNERS` who are willing to vouch for the robustness of the extension?\r\n* Is the extension absent a [low coverage exception](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/test/per_file_coverage.sh#L5)?\r\n\r\nThoughts on any others?
