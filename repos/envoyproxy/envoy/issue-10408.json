  "body": "Use case: In brownfield environments, some services may require the host header to match the name of the vm they are on, even though they are all a part of the same logical cluster.\r\n\r\nTo address that, we would like to allow auto host-rewrite to work with EDS endpoints. This applies to active http health checks as well - the host used in a health check request should come from the endpoint. \r\n\r\nI have a [POC implementation](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/compare/master...yuval-k:eds-hostname), where I add \"envoy.lb/hostname\" metadata to an endpoint to specify its hostname. \r\n\r\nWe would like to contribute this behaviour upstream. my main question is how should this go forward:\r\n- is using the metadata appropriate? or,\r\n- an api change: new field should be added to the Endpoint proto message (personally I tend to say api change).\r\n\r\nIf a field is preferred, I was thinking to add a `string hostname` field to the [Endpoint message](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/abb575aec73b505bddddcb96c5e858088f331bac/api/envoy/config/endpoint/v3/endpoint_components.proto#L22)\r\nand a `bool use_hostname` in the [HealthCheckConfig message](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/abb575aec73b505bddddcb96c5e858088f331bac/api/envoy/config/endpoint/v3/endpoint_components.proto#L26)\r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated ",
