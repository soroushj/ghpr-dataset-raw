  "body": "*Description*:\r\nThis is a more detailed version of a TODO comment I put in PR [2614](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/2614). When I added nested prefix support to the LC trie implementation, I took the shortcut of putting nested prefixes in a list under their parent prefix. That works well in many cases, but there are some real-world situations where this can lead to performance problems: for example, someone adding a short prefix to an existing large set of prefix/tag combinations.\r\n\r\nOne potentially simple solution would be to preprocess the input list of prefixes by:\r\n\r\n1. Inserting all the prefixes into a binary trie,\r\n1. Iterating through the trie to apply each prefix's tag(s) to its descendants,\r\n1. Pushing all the prefixes to the leaves ([example](https://raminaji.wordpress.com/unibit-tries/)),\r\n1. And finally extracting the resulting prefix/tags combinations from the leaves of the binary trie and using those as the input to the LC trie construction algorithm. (Because these new prefixes are the leaves of a trie, they're guaranteed to be non-overlapping.)\r\n\r\nI'm willing to contribute an implementation for this.",
