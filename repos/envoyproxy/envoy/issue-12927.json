  "body": "Different Guarddogs : a guard dog for worker threads and a guard dog for the main thread.\r\n\r\nThe main thread has different workloads than worker threads, this causes friction in systems that set thresholds for both of them as it\u2019s \u201cone-size fits all\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor example, the main thread often spends a significant amount of time on parsing new config. That amount of time would be considered excessive for a worker thread to not have finished it\u2019s event loop iteration and check in with its watchdog.\r\n\r\nThis \u201cone size fits all\u201d guard dog doesn\u2019t work. Instead we need two guard dogs, one that\u2019ll monitor the main thread and (other auxiliary threads)?, and another for the worker threads. This would allow us to better fine tune the thresholds depending on the guarddog (and what threads it watches) -- better allowing us to deploy watchdog capabilities such as watchdog actions, kill timeouts, etc.\r\n\r\nThe main trade off would be that it\u2019d be harder to enact cross-guard dog policy that would trigger if we\u2019d aggregate across guard dogs (such as multikill events), but won\u2019t trigger because they aren\u2019t sufficient within their individual guard dog to trigger that event.",
