  "body": "I'm Caleb, from Datadog's APM team. We've been looking at adding distributed tracing to the proxy\r\napplications used internally and by our customers.\r\n\r\nWe have already developed a [plugin](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-opentracing-cpp/blob/46edff8f2f5483e4774b299bdcf683720ac95c6d/examples/envoy-tracing/front-envoy.yaml#L61-L68) that works with Envoy based on the existing `dynamic.ot` tracing option, but find it a bit limiting.\r\nAdditional plugin steps are a bit inconvenient for users, and even more difficult for things that wrap a prebuilt envoy binary in a container image (eg: istio).\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a contribution that adds datadog's tracer as a direct option in envoy, alongside the existing zipkin and lightstep tracers?\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the _Envoy extension policy_ document and understand the expectations for the initial submission and ongoing maintenance.",
