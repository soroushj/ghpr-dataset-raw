  "body": "Description:\r\n\r\nSee the title.\r\n\r\nThe ActiveStream is being destroyed by a deferred delete and it is occurring after the filter chain  has been destroyed. It looks like the UpstreamRequest destructor is calling the upstream_logs_ ->log() call which in turn is calling the log() API in the filter for a filter chain which is already destroyed.  While it is easy enough to detect this and avoid using state which is no longer valid I am wondering if this is the intended design?  I would think that it would be best to avoid calls to filters on a filter chain which has already been destoryed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[optional Relevant Links:]\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-wasm/issues/615\r\n\r\nThis occurs during rapid reconfiguration of Wasm filters.\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n\r\nAdd a Wasm filter which which includes a log() handler (e.g. HTTP filter) and reconfigure the filter chains rapidly (every 2 seconds) while under load.\r\n\r\n[2020-08-11 21:13:00.416][26263][critical][backtrace]
