  "body": "*Title*: *safer example runner*\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\n> I just used envoy/examples/verify-common.sh and during its cleanup it does a docker prune, which removes ALL stopped containers.  I have dozens of containers in the stop state and use them for various unrelated activities.  While I did read the script, I didn't put it together that \"verify-....\" was going to remove things it didn't own.  I recommend injecting id information on these related containers and only delete them.  Maybe via ENV, or something like that.  If others think that is a good idea (or maybe just adding documentation or a feature gate on delete) I am open to implementing it.\r\n",
