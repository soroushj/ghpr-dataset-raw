However, it has the disadvantage that there are no permissions on abstract namespace unix domain sockets.\r\n\r\nEnvoy should support configuring a filesystem path for it's hot-restart UDS so that normal filesystem permissions can be used. This would most-likely be specified as a command-line argument.\r\n\r\n*Relevant Links*:\r\nhttp://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html",
