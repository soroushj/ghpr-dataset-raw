  "body": "We're using the subset lb with locality weights, and ran into an issue where where requests would fail when a subset excluded an entire locality. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nL1: (50% weight)\r\nhost1: metadata: A\r\nhost2: metadata A\r\nL2: (50% weight)\r\nhost3: metadata B\r\nhost4: metadata B\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe subset matching A results in:\r\n```\r\nL1: (50% weight)\r\nhost1\r\nhost2\r\nL2: (50% weight)\r\nempty\r\n```\r\n\r\nand as a result 50% of requests fail because they get routed to L2.\r\n\r\nA thing to note is that in the case where a subset ends up with an empty LB, this assert triggers: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/upstream/upstream_impl.cc#L276\r\n\r\nThis is in line with the original warnings about using subset lb and locality weighting together, but in our case we know that the entire `LocalityLbEndpoint` will have the same metadata. As such I suggest one of two solutions:\r\n\r\n1) Add a `metadata` field to `LocalityLbEndpoint` and have the subset LB exclude the *entire* locality if the metadata does not match for a given subset. This will per-locality metadata to exclude localities that do not match.\r\n\r\nNot sure how easy this would be to implement, but wanted to see if this sounds reasonable before digging into the code too much.\r\n\r\n2) Another option would be to special case (in the LB implementation perhaps?)  the case where a locality ends up with 0 weight and simply redistribute the locality weight of the empty locality between the remaining ones, proportional to their current weight. Without being super familiar with the EDF scheduler, this might just mean we exclude localities with 0 hosts from being inserted into the scheduler. \r\n\r\nA thing to note is that in the case where a subset ends up with an empty LB, this assert triggers: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/upstream/upstream_impl.cc#L276\r\n\r\nThe ASSERT makes me think that the better solution might be to adjust the locality load (my second suggestion in the original post) so that won't be accidentally running into this ASSERT.",
