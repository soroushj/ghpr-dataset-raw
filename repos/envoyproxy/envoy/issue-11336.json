Information such as VPC endpoint [2] in TLVs could be useful by other filters.\r\n\r\nCurrently TLVs are read and discarded in the Proxy Protocol filter [3]. I would like to extend the Proxy Protocol Listener filter to extract TLVs of interest and save them as metadata which can be consumed by other filters.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n1. Is there any on-going or planned work on the same issue?\r\n2. It seems \"setDynamicMetadata\" is not available yet in Proxy Protocol filter, likely because the connection has not been created yet. Wondering is there any guideline and suggestions on how to bridge that gap?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!\r\nSong   \r\n\r\n[optional Relevant Links:]\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt\r\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html#proxy-protocol\r\n[3] https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/extensions/filters/listener/proxy_protocol/proxy_protocol.cc#L234-L256",
