  "body": "We've had some requests from users of datadog tracing with Envoy about adding GRPC status as tags on the tracing spans. Most of those users are indirectly using envoy via istio.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, GRPC requests will report all the HTTP2 information, but not the grpc status code and message received from an endpoint. The goal would be setting those values as tags on the tracing span.\r\n\r\nI've had a look into the source, and at the moment it seems there's some support for this already, but only for async grpc client connections. We'd want this to work for proxied connections that are transporting grpc requests.\r\n\r\nIf this idea is reasonable, I'll be happy to jump into implementing it.",
