  "body": "The move to the v3 APIs has exposed some pain points that control plane authors are facing. It's not cheap to switch major version, in particular when lacking some of the generic API migration tooling that we have developed inside of Envoy.\r\n\r\nThe existing API lifecycle is described at https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/api/API_VERSIONING.md. We cut a new major version every year, turn down an old one each year and any major version lives at most 2 years.\r\n\r\nThis means that any technical debt in API and associated code can live up to 2 years. If we change the clock cycle to every 2 years for a new major version, we might end up having technical debt live 3 or 4 years. This seems pretty significant for a fast moving project like Envoy.\r\n\r\n@mattklein123 has proposed that we postpone cutting a new version until we have enough technical debt built up. Arguably we could keep the existing lifecycle with that approach, but instead of cutting a new API exactly every year, we have >= 1 year between major versions and have Envoy maintainers vote on whether to cut a new major version at every quarter after the year mark. This gives us both flexibility in cutting new major versions, potentially longer periods before inflicting cost on control plane authors, stability guarantees to other xDS clients, a predictable deprecation cycle, while leaving technical debt management under the control of maintainers.\r\n\r\nThis issue can track discussion, will add this to the coming community call agenda.\r\n\r\nCC @mattklein123 @envoyproxy/api-shepherds @alyssawilk @markdroth @dfawley",
