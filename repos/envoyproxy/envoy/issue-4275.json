  "body": "*Title*: **The FAQ page that documents SNI configuration is slightly incorrect and misleading**\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\n\r\nThe SNI configuration example shown in the FAQ section is incorrect because it shows supplying a string value instead of a list of strings for the `server_names` parameter. This took some time for me to debug since:\r\n\r\n- the server itself accepts this configuration without issue (though it won't work so I guess it does something else with it)\r\n- `server_names` is a strange label for a single string but I thought maybe that's just how the reference example does it and it seems to be implied that you'd duplicate the entire block containing it for SNI so I thought it might be an implementation detail that formed from that.  \r\n- it's my first rodeo (okay, it might be my 3rd)\r\n\r\nThe particular example is also confusing since according to the documentation on the `server_names` parameter both _\"www.example.com\"_ and _\"example.com\"_ would have been matched by the \"wildcard\" matching that is supposedly done for \"_www.example.com_\" so the second block would therefore never do anything. Turbine Labs, for instance, propagates this confusion in an [article](https://blog.turbinelabs.io/setting-up-ssl-with-envoy-f7c5aa06a5ce) of theirs so it seems not to be something that comes from lack of familiarity with the product. Would you consider us making the second example something like \"_api.example.com_\" instead? Then a note could be added about the wildcard matching feature taking care of parent domains. \r\n",
