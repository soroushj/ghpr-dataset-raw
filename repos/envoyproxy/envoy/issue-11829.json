  "body": "#### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently Windows does not support edge based events. As a result we rely on level based events which causes various issues.\r\n\r\nFor example in testlist [//test/common/network:connection_impl_test](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/test/common/network/connection_impl_test.cc#L1289) `FlushWriteAndDelayCloseTimerTriggerTest` the scenario that depends on setting a `setDelayedCloseTimeout` on the server.\r\n\r\nThis event on Windows is added to the queue in Windows but it gets **buried by the Level write events**. Some logs that indicate this behavior are here:\r\n```\r\n[debug] event_del: 000001FB4DB1FC78 (fd -1), callback 00007FF76C608820\r\n[debug] event_process_active: event: 000001FB4D6E48F8,  EV_WRITE  call 00007FF76C4C6670\r\n[2020-06-30 15:05:41.026][6448][trace][connection] [source/common/network/connection_impl.cc:506] [C0] socket event: 2\r\n[2020-06-30 15:05:41.026][6448][trace][connection] [source/common/network/connection_impl.cc:607] [C0] write ready[debug] event_del: 000001FB4DB1FC78 (fd -1), callback 00007FF76C608820\r\n[debug] event_process_active: event: 000001FB4D6E48F8,  EV_WRITE  call 00007FF76C4C6670\r\n[2020-06-30 15:05:41.026][6448][trace][connection] [source/common/network/connection_impl.cc:506] [C0] socket event: 2\r\n[2020-06-30 15:05:41.026][6448][trace][connection] [source/common/network/connection_impl.cc:607] [C0] write ready\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes the test to hang and exposes a limitation for envoy on windows, to set `Scheduled Callbacks` and `Timer` events.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Solution: Set event priorities\r\n\r\nWe could utilize libevent `event_base_priority_init` to create more granular priorities on jobs.\r\n\r\nCreate an enumeration with priorities and use it when we create new `SchedulableCallbackImpl`\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nenum eventPriorities:\r\n{\r\n   Standard,\r\n   High\r\n}\r\n\r\nSchedulableCallbackImpl::SchedulableCallbackImpl(Libevent::BasePtr& libevent,\r\n                                                 std::function<void()> cb, eventPriorities job_priority)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior could be limited only to Windows (or to both if we would think it has wider value)\r\n\r\n#### Questions \r\n\r\n1. How important is the scenario of `Timers` and `Scheduled Callbacks`?\r\n2. Are there any scenarios that this could cause a regression?\r\n\r\n@nigriMSFT @sunjayBhatia @wrowe ",
