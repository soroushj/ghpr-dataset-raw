  "body": "Certain filters (such as the new one to be introduced in #5315) rely on being able to mutate the body after it's been buffered, e.g. in order to insert a prefix based on payload size. The current workaround for this is to maintain a separate buffer, which is not ideal due to missing out on the flow control that the internal filter buffer is used for and also the additional code complexity of maintaining a separate buffer. \r\n\r\nWould it be reasonable to expose a non-const pointer to the HTTP filter buffer similar to how the const pointer is exposed?
