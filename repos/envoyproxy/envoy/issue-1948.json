  "body": "master in data-plane-api has some go stuff in bazel files. Its not straightforward import into Envoy. It requires copy pasting the io_bazel_rules_go into WORKSPACE or doing some stuff in the *.bzl files. I've only synced up to the non go part of the tree. Someone with bazel smarts needs to do the bazel magic to sync with master, going forward. This is an issue to track that work.\r\n\r\n",
