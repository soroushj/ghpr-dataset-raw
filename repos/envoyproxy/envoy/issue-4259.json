  "body": "Consider unix socket addresses to be internal\r\n\r\n**problem**\r\nOur Envoy mesh design configures Envoy to listen for egress requests over a unix socket. We found that Envoy ignores retry headers in this configuration because it does not consider the requests to be internal.\r\n\r\n**context**\r\nEnvoy decides whether each incoming request is \"internal\" or not, based on a variety of criteria (the best description on this seems to be [https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http_conn_man/headers#x-forwarded-for](here)).\r\n\r\nIf a request is *not* internal, some request headers are [sanitized](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/http/conn_manager_utility.cc#L129), for instance `x-envoy-retry-on` which influences retry behavior.\r\n\r\nThe logic to decide whether a request is internal seems complex and therefore it's unclear what the solution should be. Part of the solution would probably involve patching [https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/network/utility.cc#L212](isInternalAddress) to consider unix addresses to be internal, although that might be controversial for some setups.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like we might want a configuration option to ignore x-forwarded-for when deciding if a request is internal and just use the remote address, since `x-forwarded-for` and the `use_remote_address` config option seem to be mainly relevant to edge proxy contexts ",
