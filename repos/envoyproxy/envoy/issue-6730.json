  "body": "###  Support connection termination for hash based load-balancers\r\n\r\nWhen using long-lived connections (websockets / gRPC) with a hash-based load balancer for the purpose of session affinity between a connection and upstream host, there is a need to be able to kill existing connections during rehashing (host added or removed). \r\n\r\nCurrently, if a long-lived connection is active and affinitized to a specific host, when rehashing occurs there is a 1/(N hosts) chance of that long-lived connection experiencing a split-brain issue, where the current connection stays active but all new requests are routed to a new/different host.\r\n\r\nA simple use case for this is state management on a user / connection basis through the use of a `user-id` header. If we affinitize all requests (long-lived streams & unary) to a specific upstream host based on the `user-id` header, we're able to send unary requests directly to the host that also holds the active long-lived connection. This allows us to process the new incoming request and stream data through the long-lived connection. This all works well until we change the host count and rehashing occurs. When rehashing occurs, the long-lived connection stays active on its initial host but new requests can be affinitized to a different host causing the split-brain issue described above. New requests would be forwarded to a different host and said host will not be the \"owner\" of the long-lived connection.\r\n\r\nSupporting connection-termination on rehash ensures that the split-brained long-lived connections would be terminated and affinitized to the appropriate host on reconnect.\r\n\r\n**Relevant Links**:\r\n#2819\r\n\r\n",
