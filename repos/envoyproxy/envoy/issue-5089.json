  "body": "*Title*: *overprovisioning_factor ignored*\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\nWe seem to be observing the following behavior:\r\nThe control plane is sending an overprovisioning_factor for each cluster_load_assignment of 10000. This is being acknowledged by envoy and displayed in the debug logs. Additionally, we are setting priority, with one locality at priority 0, and all other localities at priority 1. Our expectation is that Envoy would route all traffic to the priority 0 locality until it had no healthy endpoints left. However, we are observing Envoy routing traffic to the other localities while there are still healthy endpoints in the priority 0 locality. \r\n\r\n*Repro steps*:\r\n* Start an Envoy instance\r\n* Start 10-20 dummy services.\r\n* Start control-plane\r\n* Divide the services into 3 localities and return cluster load assignments for each, marking two as priority 1, and one as priority 0, and configure the overprovisioning_factor to 10000.\r\n* Mark 2 services from the priority 0 locality as unhealthy.\r\n* Send traffic to the cluster through envoy. \r\n\r\nAttached are the relevant files/logs snippets/endpoint output.\r\n[cluster_load_log.txt](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/2597260/cluster_load_log.txt)\r\n[clusters.txt](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/2597261/clusters.txt)\r\n[request_logs.txt](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/2597263/request_logs.txt)\r\n[server_info.txt](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/2597264/server_info.txt)\r\n[stats.txt](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/2597266/stats.txt)\r\n[envoy-config.txt](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/2597280/envoy-config.txt)\r\n",
