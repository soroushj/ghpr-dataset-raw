  "body": "*Description*:\r\nThis PR fixes #3569.\r\n\r\nThere are two separate problems.\r\n\r\n* The reason that the root span was not being reported for the health check is that if a request was classified as a health check, it didn't finish the span. So all spans were still being created and considered sampled.\r\n\r\n* The second issue was that when the sampling decision is being made, the health check filter had not yet been invoked, and therefore was not being taken into account. Therefore I exposed the `setSampled` method in the abstract `Span` API and enabled the health check filter to explicitly set whether the span is sampled.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that potentially by the time the filter is invoked, other filters may have created child spans. However I am not sure how else we can use logic executed mid stream (i.e. the health check filter) to influence the sampling decision.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that normally the sampling decision is made when a root span for a trace is being created. With this PR, it is possible that an existing trace will have a subpart of the trace (i.e. the part  considered to be the health check) not sampled, while the remainder of the trace is still reported. Let me know if I haven't clearly explained this, as might be confusing :)\r\n\r\n*Risk Level*: Low\r\n\r\n*Testing*:\r\nNeeds tests - currently just looking for feedback on the fix.\r\n\r\n*Docs Changes*:\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n*Release Notes*:\r\nnone.\r\n",
