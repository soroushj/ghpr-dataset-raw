  "body": "Previously when a host was moved from an existing priority to a new\r\npriority, the update would not cause a host update, causing the host to\r\nessentially disappear. This was happening because the code would\r\ndetermine that it knew about the host already (it existed in another\r\npriority), but due to a lack of distinction between whether the\r\nexisting host came from the same priority (should not trigger an update)\r\nor another (should trigger another) it would not update the host list when \r\nthe only new host came from another priority, leaving it empty.\r\n\r\nThe fix involves comparing the list of hosts for the current\r\npriority with the list of hosts matched to an existing host. By being in\r\nthe list of existing hosts, the hosts must either exist in the current\r\npriority or another. By comparing these lists we can determine whether\r\nthe matched host came from a different priority, in which case we mark\r\nthe host list as changed.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Snow Pettersen <snowp@squareup.com>\r\n\r\n*Risk Level*: Medium, changes host update behavior\r\n*Testing*: Added regression test\r\n*Docs Changes*: n/a\r\n*Release Notes*: n/a\r\nFixes #4473 ",
