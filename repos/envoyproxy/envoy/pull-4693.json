  "body": "These are the code changes to add a JSON access logging mode. I am working on the docs/release notes, but wanted to get started on code review!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n- Add a new config option under `access_log` called `json_format`. This is a single level dictionary that contains strings as keys, and envoy access log format specifiers (such as `%PROTOCOL%`) as values. The specifiers will be replaced with actual values at logging time. I call this dictionary the \"format dictionary\" (as opposed to \"format string\").\r\n- You can specify only one of `format` (format string) or `json_format` (format dictionary). If neither are there, we fall back to the default string format.\r\n- Add the correct plumbing inside the configuration parsing to handle this.\r\n- Add a new access log formatter class that is instantiated with the format dictionary. It maintains the mapping of dictionary keys to loggers\r\n- Create a new class called `FormatterProvider`, to distinguish things that actually *extract* the information from a request. The things that *combine together* a bunch of `FormatterProvider`s are still called `Formatter`s. This is primarily a semantic/naming difference, but imo these are two conceptually separate things. There is, however no API difference, and if people are truly opposed to this, I could just merge them back into one `Formatter` class. This also provides a better foundation for adding more log formats in the future.\r\n- At present, only one specifier per key in the format dictionary is allowed. This is because the whole point of JSON logging is to make logs easily machine-parseable. If you can include multiple formats in the same field, then you'll be right back to parsing those manually\r\n- At present, only top-level keys are allowed in the format dictionary. This is validated at config load time. In the future, we can expand this to have nested dictionaries.\r\n\r\nRisk Level: \r\nLow. It's an optional feature that has to be explicitly enabled.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nUnit testing for the actual formatter, and config load. Also manually tested using an example config file.\r\n\r\nDocs:\r\n* Amended Access Log docs to create a notion of \"Format Strings\" and \"Format Dictionaries\". \r\n  * Put things that are common to access logs in general under \"Format Rules\", and then distinguished how strings and dictionaries are different. \r\n  * Called out restrictions on format dictionaries\r\n* Added protobuf comments for `format` and `json_format`\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\nWill have to add Release notes\r\n\r\nFixes #2692 ",
