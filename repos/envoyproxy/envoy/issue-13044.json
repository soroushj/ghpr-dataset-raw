  "body": "This is a minor nitpick on some documentation I found for the CONNECT proxy behavior that doesn't like up with the HTTP/2 spec.\r\n\r\nThe existing documentation for [`connect_matcher`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/50ef0945fa2c5da4bff7627c3abf41fdd3b7cffd/api/envoy/config/route/v3/route_components.proto#L438-L440) mentions this:\r\n\r\n> For HTTP/2, where CONNECT requests may have a path, the path matchers will work if there is a path present\r\n\r\nThe h/2 spec has this to say in [section 8.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.3):\r\n\r\n> The \":scheme\" and \":path\" pseudo-header fields MUST be omitted.\r\n\r\n> A CONNECT request that does not conform to these restrictions is\r\n> malformed (Section 8.1.2.6).\r\n\r\nI noticed that when this functionality was added in #10894, some of the implementation makes use of the path, which would seemingly violate the spec as a client should not be sending `:path` in the request.\r\n\r\nI don't think anything is _broken_ right now (CONNECT with h/1 and h/2 works great!), but I wanted to mention this to see if this is just a docs issue, or something that should actually be fixed in the implementation.",
