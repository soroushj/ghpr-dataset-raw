However, I've seen that ejection occurs regardless of what value is used \r\nfor the max. I suspect that it may not be honored due to the how small the cluster size is but couldn't find anything in the documentation saying so.\r\n\r\n*Repro steps*:\r\n\r\nI've attached [this patch file](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/1963775/outlier_detection_max_ejection_percent.txt) that patches the front-proxy example to have two hosts in the `service_1` cluster. It also updates the service to return 500s in the presence of a `fail` header. The provided script, `force_ejection.sh`:\r\n- spins up the proxy and service containers\r\n- sends some normal traffic through\r\n- sends requests to force 500s\r\n- prints out the outlier detection log to show that an ejection took place\r\n\r\n*Admin and Stats Output*:\r\n- [/stats output](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/1963795/stats.txt)\r\n- [/clusters output](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/files/1963796/clusters.txt)",
