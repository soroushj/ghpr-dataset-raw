  "body": "We run a filter internally that converts gRPC requests into HTTP/1.1 requests. This is used to allow apps that do not have good gRPC support handle requests sent from an gRPC client, allowing call sites to be uniform regardless of the gRPC capabilities of the upstream. \r\n\r\nThe filter works like this:\r\n\r\n1) Determine whether the filter should be applied based on filter metadata.\r\n2) If applicable, convert the `content-type` into the desired header. For us this is `application/x-protobuf`\r\n3) Strip the length prefix from the body (ie drain the first 5 bytes)\r\n3) Send the request to an http/1.1 upstream cluster\r\n4) If the content type does not match `application/x-protobuf`, respond with a header only response\r\nwith a useful `grpc-message` and `grpc-status: 2`\r\n5) Set response content type to `application/grpc`\r\n5) If the response code was not 200, map it to appropriate `grpc-status` code\r\n6) Otherwise, buffer entire body, compute length and insert length prefix into the start of the buffer\r\n7) Insert trailers to set `grpc-status`\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the opposite of the gRPC HTTP/1.1 bridge, providing gRPC support to the server instead of the client. It only works for unary calls. \r\n\r\nThere seemed to be some interest from people in having this upstreamed, so figured I'd put this up to see if it's worth adding. \r\n\r\nfyi @lita @junr03 ",
