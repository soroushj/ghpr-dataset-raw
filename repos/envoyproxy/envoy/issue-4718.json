  "body": "If for a particular reason, an update is rejected, Envoy sends back a response immediately indicating the failure to management server. However if management server, responds again with incorrect data with possibility of update being rejected, Envoy would send the update rejected response immediately.\r\nThis continuous flow of rejections can be quite chatty and could flood envoy with discovery requests.\r\n\r\nIt is better to implement back-off for update rejected cases with back-off starting immediately after the first failure.",
