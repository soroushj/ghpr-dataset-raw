  "body": "*Title*: *Subset load balancer: Add a fallback that uses priority/locality weighting*\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\nCurrently subset load balancing and priority/locality load balancing are mutually exclusive for a cluster. However, I have a use case where I would like to allow client either to select subsets via HTTP headers, or to elide the headers and follow priority and locality load balancing rules.\r\n\r\nCurrently the closest I can get to that is to use the ANY_ENDPOINT fallback policy, but my understanding of the docs is that it will give all hosts in the cluster an equal weighting, which isn't what I want.\r\n\r\nI can get around this requirement by doubling the number of clusters I have and having one for subset load balancing and one for priority/locality load balancing, however I'd rather avoid that if possible.",
