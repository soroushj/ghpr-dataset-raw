  "body": "During host updates on the worker threads, the subset LB calls `health()` on the list of all hosts to partition to the hosts into healthy/degraded/unhealthy vectors. Since `health()` reads from an atomic\r\nbit mask that may be modified by another thread (ie by the health checker), this may produce an inconsistent view of a given HostSet, since `health()` is called multiple times for each host. \r\n\r\nI can think of a few ways of solving this:\r\n1) Ensure we only call `health()` exactly once per host per subset update. This will ensure that the health values are consistent *within a given HostSet*. It would not guarantee that all subsets are updated with the same health values.\r\n2) Infer the health values of hosts by determining which of the healthy/degraded/all hosts on the original\r\npriority set they're in. This would ensure consistency between all subsets.\r\n\r\nLeaning towards 2), so I'll see if I can get a PR ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
