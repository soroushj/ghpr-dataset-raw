  "body": "\r\n*Title*: *AsyncClient returned by httpAsyncClientForCluster() does not follow lb_policy defined for cluster*\r\n\r\n*Symptom*:\r\nLB Policy configured on a test cluster is RING_HASH, and I observed it was honoured by all calls going through HTTP Connection manager.\r\nBut any Async call sent using AsyncClient returned by httpAsyncClientForCluster() from a filter is **not following the same LB policy**. Is this the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\n\r\nHere is what is causing the problem:\r\n\r\nIn file `upstream/cluster_manager_impl.cc` the constructor of `struct ClusterEntry` is called for each cluster defined in the config when envoy starts up.\r\n\r\n In its initializer list it invokes the constructor of `Http::AsyncClientImpl` to create http_async_client_ for the cluster. http_async_client_ is returned by httpAsyncClientForCluster()  and is used for making Async calls. \r\n\r\n`Http::AsyncClientImpl` creates `AsyncStreamImpl` which creates a mock `Router::ProdFilter router_` and sets a bunch of mock objects on it. One of the mock objects is `struct RouteEntryImpl` which defines `const Router::HashPolicy* hashPolicy() const override { return nullptr; }`.\r\n\r\n*During an async call*, when `upstream/thread_aware_lb_impl.cc` chooseHost()  is called, it tries to `computeHashKey()` but in the absence a HashPolicy, it does this:\r\n\r\n`const uint64_t h = hash ? hash.value() : random_.random();`\r\n\r\nDo you think there a way to make async calls start following the lb_policy for the cluster? \r\n\r\n",
