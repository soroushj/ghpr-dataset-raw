  "body": "Currently if Envoy is disconnected from management server, there is not a good stat that we can rely on to alert. `upstream_rq_5xx` and `upstream_cx_connect_fail` come close to indicating the problem. But they get incremented for every retry that Envoy makes to connect to the management server.If we have to alert on these we need to alert on probably sufficiently large to avoid spurious alerts on intermittent disconnections. How about adding a `management_server.disconnection_duration_ms` stat that tells for how much time Envoy is disconnected from Management Server. This may help to predictably alert on long disconnection durations. I know this is not a standard cluster metric but in the absence of a standard cluster metric that we can use to monitor long running streams can we add this custom one for management server?\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n",
