  "body": "We've been seeing occasional requests fail with UH during deploys when using active health checking.\r\n\r\nIn this case we have 4 hosts that all have equal weighting (2 in each locality, with same locality weighting and same priority):\r\n\r\nL1 has hosts A B\r\nL2 has hosts C D\r\n\r\nThis is followed by a bunch of empty priorities (probably not relevant, but mentioning for the sake of completeness).\r\n\r\nA rolling restart (no overlapping downtime, verified by looking at the hc logs) of the hosts in L2 result in calls from downstream failing with UH. Looking at the active health check logs for the downstream, we see the hosts in L2 go unhealthy, but neither A nor B have a failing health check event in the health check log. \r\n\r\nThis is a low traffic setup, so we just see one failure, and by the time the next call is made everything is back to normal.\r\n\r\nThis kinda seems like we're routing a request while we're in some intermediate state where we end up routing to a `HostSet` with no hosts, but I don't have a great explanation as to why that might happen. @htuch Any clue what might be going on?\r\n\r\nWe're seeing this on dfbb069d634884e386130dc1b74ef0ff2d4657b0",
