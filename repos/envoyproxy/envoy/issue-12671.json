I would love to see it being able to add dynamic metadata in `DeniedHttpResponse` as well. (I overlooked this while https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/11820 was WIP :( )\r\n\r\nAn example use case would be where the authorization service received correct credentials, that fact should be logged, while the  request gets denied. (e.g. customer provided credentials are correct but customer's status is deactivated)",
