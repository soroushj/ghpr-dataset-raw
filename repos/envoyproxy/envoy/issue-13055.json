  "body": "\r\n*Title*: HTTP/2 CONNECT does not return CONNECT_ERROR on upstream RST\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\nI've have a downstream proxy that tunnels TCP via HTTP/2 to a backend service. Envoy is in front of the service and provides an HTTP/2 endpoint which supports the CONNECT method. The backend (Envoy upstream) service sometimes shuts down a connection by sending a TCP RST. According to the [HTTP/2 spec](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#CONNECT), \"[a] proxy treats any error in the TCP connection, which includes receiving a TCP segment with the RST bit set, as a stream error [...] of type CONNECT_ERROR.\" While Envoy does send RST_STREAM, the error is NO_ERROR instead of CONNECT_ERROR.\r\n\r\nThe spec goes on to state that any error (stream or connection) must result in a TCP RST being sent to downstream clients, so I can work around this. However, I wanted to check if this was intended behavior.\r\n\r\n*Repro steps*:\r\nThis is reproducible with Envoy v1.15.0 configured with support for HTTP/2 CONNECT as per https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/configs/terminate_connect.v3.yaml (substituting the upstream `socket_address` as appropriate). My upstream service is MySQL. I can likely set up a more easily reproducible example if needed.\r\n\r\nWhen the upstream service sends a TCP RST (in the case of MySQL, after there is no authentication within 10 seconds of connect by default), then Envoy will send RST_STREAM with NO_ERROR as the error. However, this error should be set to CONNECT_ERROR as per the spec.\r\n\r\n*Config*:\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/configs/terminate_connect.v3.yaml\r\n\r\n*Logs*:\r\nLogs indicate a success (200).",
