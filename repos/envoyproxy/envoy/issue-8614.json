  "body": "Our current setup runs a control plane which has all of our certificates, and these are provided to our fleet of proxies via SDS\r\n\r\nWe just noticed an odd behavior where a `tls_certificate` secret was updated just yesterday, but the old certificate is still shown in the admin `/certs` endpoint... and this also seems to affect the metric `server.days_until_first_cert_expiring`\r\n\r\nThe equivalent commands I ran on the envoy node were as follows\r\n```\r\n# http GET http://localhost:9901/certs | jq '.certificates[].cert_chain[] | {days: .days_until_expiration, name: .subject_alt_names[0].dns}' | grep '<redacted common name>' --context 2\r\n{\r\n  \"days\": \"28\",\r\n  \"name\": \"<redacted common name>\"\r\n}\r\n{\r\n--\r\n{\r\n  \"days\": \"794\",\r\n  \"name\": \"<redacted common name>\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two redacted names are identical.\r\n\r\nIs this known/intended? I'm guessing there is no way to purge these old certificates and that I should just re-deploy the fleet.",
