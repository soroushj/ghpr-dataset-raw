  "body": "**Rational**\r\n\r\nFor the client to be able to actively throttle their requests they need to know their current status with regards to rate limits. A [draft RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-00.html) exists specifying `RateLimit-Limit, RateLimit-Remaining, RateLimit-Reset` headers, which seem to have fair adoption. \r\n\r\n**Prior art**\r\n\r\nA few pull requests were created in the ratelimit service https://github.com/envoyproxy/ratelimit/pull/77, taking over https://github.com/envoyproxy/ratelimit/pull/56 but they were closed due to issues with a general approach. According to @mattklein123, the better approach compared to the one taken in the pull request would be to change the ratelimit API to provide the necessary data, while setting the response headers in envoy. \r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\n\r\n1. Drop `response_headers_to_add` and `request_headers_to_add` from the RateLimitResponse proto in v4, deprecate the fields in v3 protocol per https://github.com/envoyproxy/ratelimit/pull/77#issuecomment-482272850\r\n2. Add a field to the `RateLimitResponse:DescriptorStatus:reset` supporting the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header and implement providing the data in rate limiter service.\r\n3. Implement support for `RateLimit-Limit, RateLimit-Remaining, RateLimit-Reset` in envoy ratelimit filter under a filter configuration parameter.\r\n\r\nI'm going to contribute all the code/testing if the proposal is approved by maintainers. \r\ncc @junr03 ",
