  "body": "*Title*: Request: Make statistics histogram buckets configurable\r\n\r\n*Description*:\r\nHistogram buckets are currently hardcoded to cover a wide range of values (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/stats/histogram_impl.cc#L34)\r\nMany users will benefit from customising the buckets to match their data/use case.\r\n\r\nFor example, the current buckets include a 10-30 second bucket. If the majority of an applications values fall in this bucket, the user would probably want increased resolution by having the boundaries be 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, for example.\r\n\r\nIn his implementation of histograms for Prometheus, @suhailpatel mentioned wanting to make this configurable: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/5601#discussion_r248099062",
