  "body": "If I have config (example 1):\r\n```yaml\r\nmatch:\r\n  app_protocols: [h2]\r\nmatch: {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll h2 traffic matches filter 1, and everything else matches filter 2. If I then change this to (example 2)\r\n```yaml\r\nmatch:\r\n  app_protocols: [h2]\r\n  transport_protocol: tls\r\nmatch: {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo traffic matches filter 2. I would expect filter 2 to still catch all unmatched traffic. It seems in order to do this, I need to specify: (example 3)\r\n```yaml\r\nmatch:\r\n  app_protocols: [h2]\r\n  transport_protocol: tls\r\nmatch: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this contradicts the docs a bit. Transport protocol says \"If non-empty, a transport protocol to consider when determining a filter chain match.\". In the example 2, I have set transport_protocol to `\"\"`, yet it still seems to be considering transport protocol.\r\n\r\nEven more contradicting is that changing one FCM (seems to) impacts the matching logic of another FCM! My expectation would be that a match config is independent. If I have `{}` it would always match the same inputs (from my reading, match everything, but at least should be consistent), regardless of other FCMs - other FCMs may have higher priority, but not actually prevent this one from matching.\r\n\r\ncc @lizan @rshriram ",
