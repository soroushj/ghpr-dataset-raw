  "body": "Envoy's fault filter supports abort faults. When Envoy inject an abort fault it returns a response that uses `text/plain` as its content-type and sets \"fault filter abort\" as its body.\r\n\r\nAt Lyft, mobile clients try to deserialize every response that they get from the server (or/and Envoy). There are a few known issue when it comes to deserializing responses that are sent by Envoy's fault filter when an abort fault is injected:\r\n\r\n- Even though Lyft mobile applications set `application/json` or/and `application/x-protobuf` as the value of `accept` header that they send as part of network requests that they make, Envoy filter returns a response with `content-type` equal to `text/plain`.\r\n- There is no easy way to tell when Envoy injected a fault - a mobile client would need to look for \"fault filter abort\" body of a request in order to be sure that Envoy injected a fault but hard-coding a string like this on the client is not preferable. Can a client just assume that every request with `x-envoy-fault-abort-request` HTTP header set ends up getting an abort fault in response? No, it's not that simple because of the existence of `x-envoy-fault-abort-request-percentage` HTTP header. If a client sends a request with `x-envoy-fault-abort-request` HTTP header equal to 503 and `x-envoy-fault-abort-request-percentage` equal to 10 (10%) it's up to the Envoy to decide whether a fault should be injected or not (with 10% chance of the fault being injected).\r\n\r\nBecause of the aforementioned issues with the current Envoy's fault filter responses the following changes to fault filter's responses is proposed:\r\n\r\n- Make fault filter return an empty response if an abort fault is injected.\r\n- Make fault filter set the value of `x-envoy-injected-faults` HTTP header to `abort` every time an it injects an abort fault.",
