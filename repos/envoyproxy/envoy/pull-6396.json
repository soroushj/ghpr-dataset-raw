  "body": "This fixes a bug where hosts that were moved between priorities would\r\nnot be included in the hosts_added vector, resulting in crashes if the\r\nsame host was moved multiple times when used with active health\r\nchecking: if a host was moved between priorities twice, it would first\r\nget removed from the health checker, then on the second move the health\r\nchecker would crash as it would attempt to remove a host it didn't know\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWe fix this by explicitly adding the existing host to the list of added\r\nhosts iff the host existed previously in a different priority.\r\n\r\nUncovering this bug lead to the discovery of a bug in the batch updating\r\ndone during EDS: std::set_difference assumes that the provided ranges\r\nare both *sorted*, which is not generally true during this update flow.\r\nThis meant that the filtering of hosts that were added/removed did not\r\nwork correctly, and would produce inconsistent result dependent on the\r\nordering of the host pointers in the unordered_map.\r\n\r\nWe fix this by using a standard for loop instead of std::set_difference.\r\nNot only is this more correct, it should also be faster for large sets\r\nas it performs the filtering in O(n) instead of O(n^2).\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Snow Pettersen <snowp@squareup.com>\r\n\r\nRisk Level: Medium\r\nTesting: Extended EDS UT to prove that hosts aren't added/removed\r\nDocs Changes: n/a\r\nRelease Notes: n/a\r\nFixes #6395\r\n",
