  "body": "Description:\r\n\r\nIn gRPC, the client chooses a deadline before starting an RPC; this is a fixed point in time.  When sending the RPC, gRPC attaches a header (`grpc-timeout`) containing the remaining timeout as a duration (e.g. \"10s\").  Envoy reads this timeout duration and applies it internally, but only starts the timer after the client finishes sending the request data.  This may never happen in the case of long-lived streams (e.g. pubsub), or be significantly delayed in the case of client-streaming RPCs (e.g. a large file upload).\r\n\r\nThere are two fields in a route that can affect the gRPC timeout as Envoy handles it: `max_grpc_timeout` and `grpc_timeout_offset`.  We would like to continue to support these features, but apply the proper semantics to them.  There are are three main options for this:\r\n\r\n1. Change the behavior and call it a bug fix.\r\n2. Add a client capability that affects the behavior of these fields and the handling of the `grpc-timeout` header.\r\n3. Add new fields with the proper semantics and deprecate the existing ones.\r\n\r\nSecondarily, it might be worth considering if the gRPC semantics could be useful for non-gRPC streams as well.  For example, if a client is uploading much more data on a stream than expected, or if the server is reading the data slowly for some reason, the Envoy timeouts will never be applied, and the stream will be allowed to continue indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/cf850688a93b8dea5705170a211ea98b77beda61/api/envoy/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#L960-L988\r\n\r\ncc @htuch @markdroth @ejona86",
