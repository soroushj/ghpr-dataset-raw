  "body": "I am building a network filter that has to move the content of an `Envoy::Buffer` into a proprietary library (calling it X in the rest of this description) while avoiding copies as far as possible.  The filter has to convert from an `Envoy::Buffer` to a `X::Buffer` and then allow the library to access the content beyond the scope of the current `onData()` call.  The `X::Buffer` interface is very similar to `Envoy::Buffer`, with an `X::Buffer` instance acting as a container for buffer slices.  One of the differences is that `X::Buffer` has methods to transfer ownership of buffer slices, e.g. `extractFrontSlice()`, `popFrontSlice()`, `pushFrontSlice()`.  My understanding is that `Envoy::Buffer::getRawSlices()` provides a read-only view on the slices, and that no mechanism exists to extract slices without copying.  In other words I want to avoid using `Envoy::Buffer::copyOut()` or `Envoy::Buffer::linearize()`.  I could implement a convoluted mechanism where each slice in the `Envoy::Buffer::RawSliceVector` is wrapped in a new object that keeps a reference and refcount on the source `Envoy::Buffer`, and then inject those new slice objects into the `X::Buffer` instance, effectively indirectly \u201ctransferring ownership\u201d of the `Envoy::Buffer` slices.  I would much rather prefer implementing the `X::Buffer` interface as a simple mapping of the `Envoy::Buffer` interface. I also understand that not all `Envoy::Buffer` instances are `Envoy::Buffer::OwnedImpl` instances and that the implementation for the new method(s) would sometimes result in a copy.\r\n\r\nI am available to implement the required changes.",
