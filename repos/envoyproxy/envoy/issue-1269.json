  "body": "The \"domains\" configuration within a virtual_hosts of a route config allows wildcards at the start of the domain currently, but not the tail.\r\n\r\nThis means If I do something (like for local development) where I run envoy on port 8080 locally with a name based virtual host / domains set (ideally the same one i'm going to be deploying), I have to match the port exactly inside the domains, otherwise the request doesn't match and I get a 404 from envoy, which has no immediate debugging feedback as to why it's happening\r\n\r\nOpen to writing up a patch to help implement this, but not sure what's the approach that would be preferred:\r\n1. Match domains excluding the port\r\n2. Allow \"trailing\" wildcards, so things like `example.com:80*`, `example.com:*` would properly function\r\n\r\nSome other option I haven't thought of here.",
