  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nwe would like to customize the response code of upstream reset. Right now, we see that 503 is hardcoded in [Filter::onUpstreamReset](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/ecd03a4eed07e1cfea9e9844e519b7fffada437a/source/common/router/router.cc#L864)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n**Status code**\r\nWithout Envoy, when app A was communicating with B and was not available, the A's client received connection refused. With Envoy in place, the A will receive 503 status code. We would like to differentiate this behaviour with different status code, for example 504 or 502, so our developers that this is not a problem with B itself throwing 503, but with a connection to B.\r\n\r\nIf you think that makes sense, we are ready to contribute it, but need a guidance where to put a parameters for this.",
