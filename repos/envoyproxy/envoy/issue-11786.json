  "body": "After https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/11435 the signature for httpConnPoolForCluster changed semantically, but due to implicit conversion between `Http::Protocol` and `absl::optional<Http::Protocol>` existing usages will compile just fine, but the meaning of the invocation will be slightly different. See https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk/issues/388 for an example of this causing surprising change in behavior.\r\n\r\nA similar issue can be seen here: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/tcp_proxy/tcp_proxy.cc#L434-L435 where HTTP/2 will only be selected if protocol resolution resolved to HTTP/2 - if the protocol selection is left to its default value this code will only select HTTP/2 if the `http2_protocol_options` are set on the cluster. One option would be to introduce another `httpConnPoolForCluster`-like function that allows specifying the protocol directly without doing any resolution.\r\n\r\nThis issue also begs the more general question of how to handle these kind of changes - it is possible that other out of tree code fall into the same category here where the semantic of the code changes under them.\r\n\r\ncc @mattklein123 @alyssawilk ",
