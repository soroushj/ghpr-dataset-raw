  "body": "The current handling of x-envoy-overloaded disables retries whenever this header is returned from the upstream. As a result, requests that fail due to circuit breakers on the ingress side in a mesh setup can result in the downstream request failing without any retries being attempted simply because one of the upstream hosts was overloaded. \r\n\r\nWe should consider removing this behavior, instead recommending configuring retry circuit breakers on egress to prevent retry storms.",
