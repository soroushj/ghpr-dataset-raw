  "body": "Currently the tcp filter allows you to route to a cluster, but hard codes an empty `MetadataMatchCriteria` (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/common/filter/tcp_proxy.h#L148). \r\n\r\nI'd love to be able to specify a `metadata_match` criteria in the tcp_filter config, to avoid me having to generating a unique cluster for each tcp routing I want. Instead, I'd set up a single cluster with various metadata match criteria based on the filter chain.\r\n\r\nThis seems like an easy enough task to do (just plum through a new config to the tcp_filter), so I'd be happy take a stab at implementing this if it seems like a reasonable idea.
