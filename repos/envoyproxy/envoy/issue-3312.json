  "body": "Suppose Envoy has been previously configured with EDS with two localities, L1 and L2 with priorities 0 and 1 respectively. Sending an EDS update that only contains L1 does not remove L2 from the cluster. \r\n\r\nLooking at the code, this is because in `EdsClusterImpl::onConfigUpdate` we look at all the priorities found in the new config and iterate over the priority sets corresponding to those priorities on the cluster, leaving any other priority set untouched. As a result we ignore (i.e. don't remove) priorities that are not present in the incoming config update. \r\n\r\nI'd expect removing an entire priority from EDS to work the same way as removing any other group of hosts. \r\n\r\nFailing test case: https://github.com/snowp/envoy/commit/c892cac9181284044ec7bf5d129a8d1e063aa474\r\n\r\nFiling this mostly for informational purposes as I'm already working on getting this fixed. \r\n",
