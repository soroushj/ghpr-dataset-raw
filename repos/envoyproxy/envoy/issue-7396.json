  "body": "I would like to be able to pass the original downstream remote IP + port to my service when using Envoy as an ingress HTTP proxy.  At the moment, I can get hold of the remote IP, either reading it from the `x-envoy-external-address` header, or adding my own custom HTTP header using the `%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT%` specifier - but as far as I can tell there is no way to add an HTTP header that contains the downstream port.  I considered using the Lua filter, but that doesn't have any connection-level data available to it either.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?   Would there be value in adding `%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS%` to the custom header parameters, so that port information can also be passed through?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
