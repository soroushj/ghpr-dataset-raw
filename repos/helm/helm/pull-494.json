    "description": "#### Operational CLI Commands\r\n\r\nTODO: Milestones do not allow checkboxes to be checked, so we should track these as meta issues, not milestones. Until then, we're marking things as \"checked\" by striking them through (e.g. ~~done~~)\r\n\r\n~~`helm server <command>`~~\r\n- ~~`install`~~\r\n\r\n- ~~`uninstall`~~\r\n\r\n\r\n~~`helm deploy` - @jackgr and @sparkprime~~\r\n\r\n~~`helm deployment delete` - @technosophos and @adamreese~~\r\n\r\n~~`helm deployment list` - @technosophos and @adamreese~~\r\n\r\n~~`helm deployment describe` - @vaikas-google and @michelleN~~\r\n~~- doesn't have to have layout~~\r\n\r\n~~`helm deployment get` - @technosophos and @adamreese~~\r\n\r\n~~`helm repo` - @jackgr, @vaikas-google and @michelleN~~\r\n- ~~`list`~~\r\n- ~~`add`~~\r\n- ~~`remove`~~\r\n- only public repos will be supported for now\r\n\r\n~~`helm chart create`~~\r\n\r\n~~`helm chart package`~~\r\n\r\nhelm chart support - @jackgr and @sparkprime\r\n  - ~~go template support~~\r\n  - ~~expandybird support~~\r\n  - ~~expansion-time dependencies (template -> chart) only~~\r\n  - ~~layout support~~\r\n  - ~~plugable template services~~\r\n  - no go template validation for now\r\n\r\n#### Project Quality Improvements\r\n\r\n~~1. @vaikas-google to write documentation on managing charts since we punted on\r\n    chart publishing for mvp~~\r\n2. passing automated end to end tests for every Helm client command with 70% coverage.\r\n3. passing unit tests with 70% overall coverage.\r\n4. ~~go report card score of A or better.~~\r\n5. ~~documentation for all actions described above~~\r\n6. ~~getting started guide (\"How do I\" guide)~~\r\n7. ~~Create an easy way to get prebuilt client binaries~~\r\n8. ~~At release time there will be prebuilt server side components available to download - @adamreese and @jackgr~~\r\n9. ~~Public chart repo - @sparkprime, @runseb and @jackgr~~\r\n  - ~~charts that work~~\r\n  - ~~a process for contribution including how we'll handle CLAs~~\r\n\r\n#### Things Not In MVP\r\n1. update application (redeploy)\r\n2. linting charts\r\n3. doctor\r\n4. credentials (punt to gs tooling for publishing)\r\n5. using kubernetes deployments\r\n6. chart\r\n  - no other template formats\r\n  - deployment(run)-time dependencies\r\n\r\nIn case there is any doubt - this milestone will result in release of a helm version out into the world.\r\n",
