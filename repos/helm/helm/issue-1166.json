  "body": "The [repo index file](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/chart_repository.md#the-index-file) has a field called `checksum`. After reading through the code that generates/verifies this file I think we need to change it in a few ways based on lessons learned in OCI, AppC, and Docker Images.\n1. Use a hash that isn't sha1 ([as it uses today](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/pkg/repo/repo.go#L173)), even though it has performance problems compared to sha512 most systems in the ecosystem are using sha256.\n2. The field should be probably be renamed Digest based on the pretty standard [hashFn(input) -> digest language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)\n3. The field should describe the cryptographic hash used to generate the digest in a well-known format, e.g. (sha256:cafecafecafe) to future proof the system, this is what OCI and AppC do.\n4. The [doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/chart_repository.md#the-index-file) describing the index file should be clear about the algorithms used and the digest serialization format. We can borrow from OCI: https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/descriptor.md#digests-and-verification\n\nDoes this all seem reasonable? I can work up a PR.\n",
