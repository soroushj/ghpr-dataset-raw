  "body": "Currently `helm repo index`  just takes the local directory for the indexing the charts which would mean that we need to always have a local copy of all the charts for it to index properly which will is pain when we want to add new charts to the repo. So, having an option to do an append to the existing index will be a nice option to have which would mean we just need the index.yaml to index and upload a chart.\n",
