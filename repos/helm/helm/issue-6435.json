  "body": "Helm 2 and Helm 3 use the same naming convention for release versions. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n`RELEASE-NAME.v1 ..... RELEASE-NAME.vN, where 'N' is the incremental number of versions of the release RELEASE-NAME`\r\n\r\nThis storage for Helm 2 is as follows:\r\n```console\r\n$ kubectl get configmap/secret -n kube-system -l \"OWNER=TILLER\"\r\nNAME         DATA   AGE\r\nchrt-v2.v1   1      42s\r\nchrt-v2.v2   1      12s\r\n```\r\n\r\nand for Helm 3:\r\n```console\r\n$ kubectl  get secrets -n default\r\nNAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE\r\nchrt-v2.v1            helm.sh/release                       1      15s\r\nchrt-v2.v2            helm.sh/release                       1      15s\r\n```\r\n\r\nHelm 2 and Helm 3 can be installed concurrently to manage the same cluster. This works when Helm 2 uses `ConfigMaps` for storage as Helm 3 uses `Secrets` for storage. **There is however a conflict when Helm 2 uses `Secrets` for storage and stores the release in the same namespace as the release.** The conflict occurs because Helm 3 uses different tags and ownership for the secret objects that Helm 2 does. It can therefore try to create a release that it thinks does not exist but will fail then because Helm 2 already has a secret with that name in that namespace. Here is an example of where this can occur: https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3/issues/30#issuecomment-531335572\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Helm 2 can be migrated to enable Helm 3 to manage releases previously handled by Helm 2: https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3.  This also works when Helm 2 uses `ConfigMaps` for storage as Helm 3 uses `Secrets` for storage. There is a conflict again however when using secrets because of the same naming convention. Refer to following issue for more details: https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3/issues/30\r\n\r\nA possible solution around this would be for Helm 3 to use a different naming convention for release versions.
