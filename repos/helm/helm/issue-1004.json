  "body": "A command named `helm rollback RELEASE [VERSION]` should be added to allow a user to replace the current version of a release with a previous version of a release.\n\nIdeally, this would work not as an \"upgrade\" to an old version, but as a hard reset to the old version. In other words, it would re-create the old resources as they were, destroying the newer version first.\n\nIn the backend, the versioning and storage should look like this:\n\n| Record | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| foo, v1 | Initial release |\n\nUser runs `helm update foo`\n\n| Record | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| foo, v1 | Initial release |\n| foo, v2 | Upgraded release |\n\nUser runs `helm rollback foo v1`\n\n| Record | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| foo, v1 | Initial release |\n| foo, v2 | Upgraded release |\n| foo, v3 | Copy of \"Initial release\" |\n\nThis way, a pristine and linear history is maintained.\n\nOpen question: For a rollback, to we re-template the release or re-release exactly? Re-templating might trigger certain functions like `date` to generate new values. To me, this sounds like a good thing.\n",
