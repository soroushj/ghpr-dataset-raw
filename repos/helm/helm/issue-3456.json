  "body": "Including the TLS command-line options on every call is tedious so I created a wrapper script that does:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    exec helm \\\r\n      --tls \\\r\n      --tls-verify \\\r\n      --tls-ca-cert=/path/to/ca.pem \\\r\n      --tls-cert=/path/to/cert.pem \\\r\n      --tls-key=/path/to/key.pem \\\r\n      \"$@\"\r\n \r\nThis works fine for commands like \"helm ls\" or \"helm install\" that communicate with Tiller but fails with *Error: unknown flag: --tls* with \"helm\", \"helm search\" or \"helm repo list\" for those that don't.  \r\n\r\nCould this be changed to that these command-line options are allowed for all helm commands, but are ignored  when not communicating with Tiller?\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to add support for for a TILLER_TLS_* environment variables that are used like HELM_HOST or TILLER_NAMESPACE.  Then we could set the environment variables:\r\n\r\n    export HELM_TLS_ENABLE=true\r\n    export HELM_TLS_VERIFY=true\r\n    export HELM_TLS_CA_CERT=/path/to/ca.pem\r\n    export HELM_TLS_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem\r\n    export HELM_TLS_KEY=/path/to/key.pem\r\n\r\nand all helm commands would work without lots of command-line options.  Perhaps doing both would make sense.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
