Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nCloses #7174\r\n\r\nPreviously in Helm 2, `helm repo add` would prompt for your password if you only provided the `--username` flag. This helps prevent someone's credentials from being logged in their shell's history, from showing up in process lists, and from being seen by others nearby.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nThis is my first time contributing to a large open-source project, please let me know if anything else is needed or desired and I'll do my best to address the concerns as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [ ] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [ ] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n",
