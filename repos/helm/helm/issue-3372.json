  "body": "The flag `--recreate-pods` no longer works as expected. There are two problems:\r\n\r\n- If there is no patch, recreation is not executed. But excactly when there is no patch the flag would be useful. When the feature was added, the function would not immediately return when there was no patch. The following commit seems to have changed this: https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/commit/0f461ba8b55cdfad6d10c8fa9caa658ecddefbd6#diff-a483d6c0863082c3df21f4aad513afe2R394. Was this change intentional?\r\n- Only resources with specific API versions have been eligible for a restart since the check for a selector was introduced in #1956. I'm working on a fix for the first point. I managed to get recreation working for Deployments with APIVersion `extensions/v1beta1` only, not for `apps/v1beta1` onwards. This should not depend on specific APIVersions.\r\n",
