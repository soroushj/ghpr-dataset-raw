  "body": "There need to be better documentation and awareness around the fact that tiller allows everyone to talk to it as default, also from inside the cluster.\r\nI first thought that there wasn't a way to talk to tiller from inside the cluster, but setting `HELM_HOST=\"tiller-deploy.kube-system:44134\"`, then using the normal helm client proved me wrong.\r\n\r\nThis should be warned about! Else tiller might be an easy way to take over the cluster from a random container.\r\n\r\nA NetworkPolicy that blocks all is helping:\r\n\r\n```\r\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\r\nkind: NetworkPolicy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: tiller-deny-all\r\n  namespace: kube-system\r\nspec:\r\n  podSelector:\r\n    matchLabels:\r\n      app: helm\r\n      name: tiller\r\n  policyTypes:\r\n  - Ingress\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt still allows me to run helm from my admin-pc.\r\n\r\nI did also find some docs about setting up tls between helm and tiller. But I really don't think many are following them. Specially when it contains a lot of `openssl ...` commands.\r\n\r\nMaybe a revisit on the authentication model for helm/tiller is in scope?",
