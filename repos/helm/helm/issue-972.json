  "body": "Release names cannot be used again, after a named release has been deleted.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n> helm install atlas/cluster-monitoring-0.1.0 --name monitoring\n> helm delete monitoring\n> helm install atlas/cluster-monitoring-0.1.0 --name monitoring\nError: a release named \"monitoring\" already exists\n> helm delete monitoring\nError: [services \"heapster\" not found, deployments.extensions \"monitoring-influxdb-grafana-v2\" not found, services \"monitoring-influxdb\" not found, services \"monitoring-grafana\" not found, deployments.extensions \"heapster-v10\" not found]\n```\n\nThis is a different error message that is generated for deletion of a release that has never been created before. \n\nFrom #helm channel chat, it seems that release names are retained forever so that helm can do delete rollbacks in the future - however some sort of a 'force' flag might be appropriate?\n",
