  "body": "When installing a cluster for the first time using `kubeadm` v1.6.1, the initialization defaults to setting up RBAC controlled access, which messes with permissions needed by Tiller to do installations, scan for installed components, and so on. `helm init` works without issue, but `helm list`, `helm install`, and so on all do not work, citing some missing permission or another.\r\n\r\nA work-around for this is to create a service account, add the service account to the tiller deployment, and bind that service account to the ClusterRole `cluster-admin`. If that is how it should work out of the box, then those steps should be part of `helm init`. Ideally, a new ClusterRole should be created based on the privileges of the user instantiating the Tiller instance, but that could get complicated very quickly.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, there should be some word in the documentation so that users installing helm using the instructions included within won't be wondering why they can't install anything.\r\n\r\nSpecific steps for my workaround:\r\n```\r\nkubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller\r\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller\r\nkubectl edit deploy --namespace kube-system tiller-deploy #and add the line serviceAccount: tiller to spec/template/spec\r\n```",
