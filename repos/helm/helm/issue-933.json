  "body": "I was setting up a chart that used a MariaDB chart and created a `name` function in `./templates/_helpers.tpl` and `./charts/mariadb/templates/_helpers.tpl`. When doing a dry-run install I found that the MariaDB chart would ignore the definition of `name` in it's helpers and use the parent's instead. This was a weird side-effect, and since functions are not namespaced it would be easy to accidentally override.\n\nAfter digging into it further though, I renamed `name` in MariaDB's helper to `mariadbName` and that caused this error:\n\n```\nError: render error in \"templates/mariadb-svc.yaml\": template: templates/mariadb-svc.yaml:4:19: executing \"templates/mariadb-svc.yaml\" at <{{template \"mariadbN...>: template \"mariadbName\" not defined\n```\n\nSo it seems that MariaDB's helpers are not being evaluated. Any ideas?\n",
