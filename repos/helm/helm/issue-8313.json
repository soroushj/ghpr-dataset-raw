  "body": "The helm `completion` command supports the `bash` shell and `zsh` shell.  With #8111, it will also support the fish shell.  The fish shell introduces a *description* for a completion.  For example:\r\n```\r\n$ helm s<TAB>\r\nsearch  (search for a keyword in charts) \r\nshow  (show information of a chart) \r\nstatus  (display the status of the named release)\r\n``` \r\nWe want to allow the user to disable descriptions, in case they don't like having them.  So #8111 introduces the `--no-descriptions` to the `completion` command.  However, this flag does not make sense at this time for neither `bash` nor `zsh`, but the flag still applies to them.  It is not a big deal, but we could do better.\r\n\r\n",
