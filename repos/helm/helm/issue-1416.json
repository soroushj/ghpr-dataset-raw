It is:\n\n> list of charts should be here at some point\n\nThis implies that the list of charts being served by the local helm server will be present on this page when there are charts being served.  So two requests here:\n1. an update to the default index.html file that specifies 'the list of charts will be present in a future release'\n2. a more robust page that contains the information present in the chart's Chart.yaml and a link to the chart tarball\n",
