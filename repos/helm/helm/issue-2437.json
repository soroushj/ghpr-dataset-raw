  "body": "This is basically a generalized version of the _bug_ #2257, possibly other filed issues and a failure mode that I've encountered today.\r\n\r\nIt seems that helm does not care if _for some unknown class of reasons_ a deployment fails. Helm will report the failure but then happily false-successfully re-deploy the same chart, without changing the actual state but registering a new state in a history config map (revision). \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to trigger helm's schizophrenia:\r\n\r\n1. #2257\r\n1a. Install a chart that contains a property that is yet unknown to helm, e.g. `envFrom` before helm v2.4.0: true success\r\n1b. Upgrade the release with a change in its chart that may or may not be related to that property, thus triggering the patch code path: failure\r\n1c. Upgrade the release again without any change: the cluster is in an undefined state and helm lies about it. :(\r\n\r\n2. 2a. Install a chart that is both valid and fully supported by helm. My case includes a ClusterRoleBinding: deployment is successful, obviously.\r\n2b. Change the ClusterRoleBinding using an invalid {kind: ServiceAccount, subjects.name:}. Deployment fails as it should.\r\n2c. Deploy the same chart again w/o any changes since 2b. This deployment falsely succeeds and helm is in the same schizophrenic state as in case 1. \r\n\r\n/cc @tback @jayme-github",
