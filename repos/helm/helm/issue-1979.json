  "body": "When I run `helm package` on a directory that contains chart information, for example `chart/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n><> helm package chart/\r\nError: directory name (chart) and Chart.yaml name (foo) must match\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is inconsistent with `helm install`, as I can install any arbitrary directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n><> helm install chart/\r\nNAME:   foo\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom a conversation on Slack, there's no technical reason why this is a limitation other than technical debt that wasn't removed before helm v2.0.0 was released. For Helm 3.0, I propose this limitation should be removed so that I may be able to name my chart package under any directory so long as it follows [the chart conventions in the design doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md#the-chart-file-structure).",
