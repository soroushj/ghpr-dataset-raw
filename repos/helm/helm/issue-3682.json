  "body": "This is a minor feature request/suggestion as I know this doesn't happen often in a given workflow.\r\n\r\nWhen I do `helm repo index --merge index.yaml <DIR>` it (obviously) doesn't like it when `index.yaml` doesn't exist nor does it like having an empty file. It would be good to have a flag that would `init` the file if it is missing.\r\n\r\nI run my helm build/index flow through a docker image and currently I have this command (simplified a bit) to account for a missing `index.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n /bin/bash -c \"( ! test -e index.yaml && helm repo index . ) || helm repo index --merge index.yaml .\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot bad, but also feels a bit much for a missing index file :)",
