  "body": "this is a feature request first.\r\n\r\ni want to have a stop logic, but there are only  install/uninstall.\r\n\r\nmy logic is when we execute `helm stop`, it will scale the pod  replicas to 0. \r\n\r\nmy case is that when we have a small cluster but we  want to use the cluster more efficiently, it can help us rapidlly recover a running helm release pod, and without losing any thing in pvc. if we use `helm delete`, it may loose some thing ,pvc , dynamic ingress, etc . but use `helm stop`, it indeed runnig no pods, and make the cpu/memory resources availiable to the ohter. \r\n\r\nwe are on dev/test env , not production, so it will not have the same cluster size with the production.",
