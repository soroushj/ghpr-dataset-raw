  "body": "Is there any interest in having a containerized version of `test-style` available through the `Makefile`. I imagine it as `make containerized-test-style` or something similar. For me, the main benefit would be not having to download all of the linters to my global go environment.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anyone other than me would use this, and I'll submit a pr :)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",
