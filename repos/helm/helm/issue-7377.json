  "body": "Currently when using helm SDK, a `RESTClientGetter` is needed. This is trivial when a kubeconfig file is available. However when the program only have access to the CA, token/certs and url in memory, it becomes a bit more complicated. \r\n\r\nIn fact the program needs to implement the following interfaces:\r\n- `ToRESTConfig() (*rest.Config, error)`\r\n- `ToDiscoveryClient() (discovery.CachedDiscoveryInterface, error)`\r\n- `ToRESTMapper() (meta.RESTMapper, error)`\r\n\r\nOf course it can still be done with some magic, but then it is also needed to create a new abstraction over the namespace with the `ToRawKubeConfigLoader()` method. \r\n\r\nA fix would be to add a `Namespace` field to the kube client in order to lighten a bit the custom implementation written to use Helm3 without a kubeconfig\r\n\r\n\r\n",
