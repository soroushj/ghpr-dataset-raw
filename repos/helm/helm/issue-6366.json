It should use the `helm` binary found in `HELM_INSTALL_DIR` instead\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm version\r\nClient: &version.Version{SemVer:\"v2.14.3\", GitCommit:\"0e7f3b6637f7af8fcfddb3d2941fcc7cbebb0085\", GitTreeState:\"clean\"}\r\n\r\n$ export HELM_INSTALL_DIR=/Users/cipriano/bin\r\n\r\n$ $HELM_INSTALL_DIR/helm version\r\nClient: &version.Version{SemVer:\"v2.12.3\", GitCommit:\"eecf22f77df5f65c823aacd2dbd30ae6c65f186e\", GitTreeState:\"clean\"}\r\n\r\n$ ./get --version v2.14.3\r\nHelm v2.14.3 is already v2.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of an edge case, where a user has `helm` installed and available on their `PATH`, but wants to install another version to a specific `HELM_INSTALL_DIR`. Currently it will take no action if the desired specified version to be installed is the same as the version available in `PATH`, regardless of what version is found at `HELM_INSTALL_DIR`. What it should do is check the version of `helm` using the binary located at `HELM_INSTALL_DIR` and update the version there if appropriate.",
