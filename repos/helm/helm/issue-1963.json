  "body": "We want to be able to add metadata in the chart that can be used to determine whether a particular chart is deprecated or not. This metadata should live in the Chart.yaml file, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname: my-chart\r\nversion: 0.1.0\r\ndescription: My deprecated chart\r\ndeprecated: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe field should be optional, and default value `false` so that non-deprecated charts can simply omit the field.\r\n\r\nOne issue with this approach is that the Chart.yaml is tied to a specific version of the chart, and so there may be some confusion over whether just a particular version of the chart is deprecated, or all versions are. In my opinion, we need to make it clear that this field indicates that all versions of the chart are deprecated. For greater flexibility, we could say that if the latest version of a chart is marked as deprecated, then the whole chart is deprecated (the index is ordered, so you just need to look at the first entry for a particular chart). This would give us the ability to later un-deprecate a chart, by simply publishing a new version without the field.\r\n\r\nWith this field, the approach we will follow in the kubernetes/charts repositories to deprecate a chart will be to submit a PR that:\r\n- updates the Chart.yaml to add the deprecated field\r\n- add a notice at the top of the README\r\n- add a notice in NOTES.txt\r\n\r\nThe human-readable notices will allow us to briefly explain why a chart was deprecated, and possibly point to a replacement.\r\n\r\nAfter merging, we should follow up with a PR that removes the directory from the git repository.\r\n\r\ncc @migmartri @viglesiasce @mgoodness @lachie83 @technosophos \r\n",
