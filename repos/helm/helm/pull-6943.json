  "body": "Fixes #6871 \r\nCaused by #6736 \r\n\r\n## What this PR does / why we need it:\r\n\r\n`Update()` gets repo names before resolving a lock file by calling `resolveRepoNames(req)`. But that method changes aliased repo URLs into the actual URLs. That makes digests from `helm update` and `helm build` be different for each other.\r\n\r\nTo make them in sync, setting actual (resolved) repo URLs into the loaded chart during `helm build` is necessary. Thus, this commit adds an extra step in the `Build()` implementation.\r\n\r\nFor comments, this commit also changes the name of `getRepoNames()` into `resolveRepoNames()` to avoid misunderstanding since getters are expected to not mutate its input data in general.\r\n\r\n~~Also, like `Update()`, `Build()` is changed to be finished immediately if there is no dependency.~~\r\n(Edited: remove this feature since nil chart deps & non-nil lock deps should return out-of-sync error)\r\n\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n",
