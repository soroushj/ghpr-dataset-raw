  "body": "Today I was getting this error when running a command like this:\n\n```\nhelm upgrade [release_name] [chart_path] --values custom_values.yaml --set foo=bar\nError: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 15: mapping values are not allowed in this context\n```\n\nThe error was not being very helpful and after a lot of back and I found that the **problem was `custom_values.yaml` didn't have a new blank line at the end of the file**. Adding a new line to it solved the problem. \n\nHowever I think helm either should prevent this error (handling a values file without that new line) or provide a better error  \u2013 or at least mention this pitfall in the docs.\n",
