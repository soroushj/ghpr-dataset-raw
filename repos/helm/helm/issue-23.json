  "body": "Assuming #22, the CLI should be able to:\n- [x] add and remove type registries for the user\n- [x] set the default type registry for other commands\n- [x] list the types and versions in a type registry\n- [ ] print the metadata for a specific type version\n\nWe do not need a way to fetch a type definition or schema, a place to put type definitions or schemas on the localhost, or a way to upload changes to a type definition or schema, since git provides all of that functionality for us, with many supporting features, such as issues, pull requests, etc.\n\nThis approach is consistent with our philosophy that config is code, and should be treated as such.\n",
