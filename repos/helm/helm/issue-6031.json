Helm install a chart with resources X, Y, and Z (it doesn't seem to matter which).\r\n2. Helm upgrade chart to add resource W (in this case a CronJob) - success\r\n```\r\n$ helm upgrade --install --wait --timeout 600 --namespace myNamespace -f someValues.yaml test .\r\nRelease \"test\" has been upgraded.\r\nLAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jul 17 10:14:58 2019\r\nNAMESPACE: myNamespace\r\nSTATUS: DEPLOYED\r\n<snip>\r\n==> v1beta1/CronJob\r\nNAME                          SCHEDULE     SUSPEND  ACTIVE  LAST SCHEDULE  AGE\r\ntest-myCron * */1 * * *  False    0       <none>         6s\r\n<snip>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Helm upgrade again, with or without changing anything - failure\r\n```\r\n$ helm upgrade --install --wait --timeout 600 --namespace myNamespace -f someValues.yaml test .\r\nUPGRADE FAILED\r\nError: kind CronJob with the name \"test-myCron\" already exists in the cluster and wasn't defined in the previous release. Before upgrading, please either delete the resource from the cluster or remove it from the chart\r\nError: UPGRADE FAILED: kind CronJob with the name \"test-myCron\" already exists in the cluster and wasn't defined in the previous release. Before upgrading, please either delete the resource from the cluster or remove it from the chart\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can delete the CronJob (or whatever resource was added) with `kubectl` and repeat steps 2 and 3 with the same results. Adding `--debug` doesn't add anything of value.\r\n\r\nIt seems related to #1193 but, if I'm reading it correctly, in that issue the deployment would have failed in step 2.",
