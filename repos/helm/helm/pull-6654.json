  "body": "`.Get()` calls `perform()` on a list of infos, populating two shared maps to display the resources fetched. As of #5611 (introduced in 2.15.0), `perform()` now concurrently calls `ResourceActorFunc` concurrently based on GVK, causing a data race condition in `.Get()`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that condition by locking the function to ensure these functions run serially for Helm 2 to fix the data race condition. This code has since been refactored out in Helm 3 so it's no longer an issue there.\r\n\r\nTo verify, run `go test` with the `-race` flag.\r\n\r\ncloses #6617\r\ncloses #6643 \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Fisher <matt.fisher@microsoft.com>",
