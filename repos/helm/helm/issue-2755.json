  "body": "The [template plugin](https://github.com/technosophos/helm-template) fills a need for chart developers and testing systems that need to work without requiring an active Tiller or k8s cluster. \r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe template plugin does not provide parity with Helm with regards to newer features that alter final  output via mechanisms like Import Values and Tags and Conditions. Maintaining the template plugin separately is more work and will often result in an outdated feature set.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\nWe should integrate the template plugin functionality into core so that chart developers have a built-in command to render charts locally and see output that matches what is expected from a `helm install`.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nThe plugin can be integrated with its functionality more or less \"as is\" except it could be downstream in the pipeline and render what would normally be the final chart being sent to Tiller. Any new features and flags should \"just work\" with the template output. \r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\nMuch of the Tiller rendering logic will be compiled into the Helm client increasing the size of the binary and increasing maintenance costs due to adding a new (small) feature.\r\n\r\n### Command\r\nThe command `template` would be added and would render all templates in the final chart (including its sub-charts) to standard out:\r\n```\r\nhelm template foo\r\n```\r\nThe above command would render all templates in the foo chart and its sub-charts\r\n```\r\n---\r\n# Source: foo/templates/service.yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Service\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: RELEASE-NAME-foo\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Opens\r\nSince the output only contains rendered templates, should we include a `--debug` flag so that developers can see computed values etc?",
