  "body": "Broken out from #690\n\nDefine a hook system for helm supporting at least the following hooks:\n- pre-install: fires before the templates for a chart are created during a `helm install CHART`. The release information will be available to the hook, but the release itself will not be created in Kubernetes.\n- post-install: fires after the helm templates are pushed into Kubernetes (but possibly before the resources are all running, since we don't wait for those)\n- pre-upgrade: fires before the templates for a chart are evaluated during a `helm upgrade RELEASE`.\n- post-upgrade: first after the release's updated resources have been loaded into Kubernetes.\n- pre-delete: fires before `helm delete RELEASE` actually sends a delete operation\n- post-delete: fires after the list of deleted resources has been sent to Kubernetes\n\nCharts will be able to declare Kubernetes jobs that run at these hook points.\n",
