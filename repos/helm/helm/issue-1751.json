  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nToday (v2.1.0) if you specify `--set` a second time to install it is ignored.\r\nThat is surprising and possibly would lead to a bad situation like a\r\ndefault admin password instead of the one the user thought they were\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the solution is to support multiple `--set` options,\r\nas it is nicer for scripting, and possibly interactive use as well.\r\n\r\n  * It allows for multiple options to be built up more easily in a script (no checking if it's the first option to avoid prepending a comma).\r\n  * It avoids long lines\r\n  * It scans better to see where each option is and what the value is\r\n\r\nI realise that there is a yaml file for specifying values in an even nicer way,\r\nbut if you are writing a bash script that generates some of the values\r\n(the image tag, random passwords for a test), you don't want to try\r\nand serialize valid yaml, it's easier to build a command line.\r\n\r\nIt would even pave the way to allow commas in values with some other\r\noption to turn on that backwards-incompatible behaviour.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJames\r\n",
