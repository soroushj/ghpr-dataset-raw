Chart A also defines a values.yaml for A default values. Chart B exists in a repo, the chart contains a values.yaml that provides B default values for the chart, and cannot be edited. Finally, some values of Chart B need to be overridden, even root values: \r\n\r\n```\r\n# chart B values.yaml provides B defaults:\r\nsomeRootVar: someValue\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n# chart A values.yaml, attempt to override B defaults: \r\nB:\r\n    someRootVar: someOtherValue\r\n```\r\nThis does not work. How to override B's someRootVar so it has value someOtherValue instead of someValue, either via A's values.yaml, or by adding an extra values files that helm knows is to override B defaults? ",
