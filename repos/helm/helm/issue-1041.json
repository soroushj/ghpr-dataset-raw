  "body": "I\u2019m using helm as part of some automation (to run a loadtest) and would welcome the `helm init` command to be idempotent.\n\nCurrently, when running `helm init` multiple times, it fails on any run but the first:\n\n```\n$ helm init\n$HELM_HOME has been configured at $HOME/.helm.\n\nTiller (the helm server side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.\nHappy Helming!\n\n$ helm init\n$HELM_HOME has been configured at $HOME/.helm.\nError: error installing: deployments.extensions \"tiller-deploy\" already exists\n\n$ echo $?\n1\n```\n\nThis results in my automation having to run `kubectl delete rc --namespace=kube-system tiller-rc`, then retry `helm init`, which is ugly use of an implementation detail.\n\nInstead, the expected result would be for helm to return with exit code 0 when the initialization succeeded \u2014 and in my opinion, initialization was successful when helm was already previously initialized :).\n\nWhat do you think?\n",
