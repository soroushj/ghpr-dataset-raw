  "body": "Are there any docs on using helm _in_ a k8s cluster with RBAC enabled?  For example, I have a pod in a cluster that wants to `helm install` a chart into the same cluster.  In general this seems to work fine, but if RBAC is enabled, you can run into issues.  Any docs on what (cluster)roles might be needed in this situation would be very helpful.",
