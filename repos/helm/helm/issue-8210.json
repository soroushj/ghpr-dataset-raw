  "body": "In Helm v2, we had the ability to set an environmental variable to pass in the passphrase to the GPG private key using $HELM_KEY_PASSPHRASE. (Added in [pull 4778](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/4778/files/b0a32d089e5fa91594cdba8b62ecae8ed5294751))\r\n\r\nIn Helm v3, that feature does not appear to exist. The only passphraseFetcher implemented is in [helm/pkg/action/package.go](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/d0422e6d82b9d7ddc9c24f02ed1f7d321f9e2646/pkg/action/package.go) on line 136.\r\n\r\nWithout this option, we can't make use of `helm package --sign` from CI/CD tools (like Azure DevOps, which I'm currently using), because the `terminal.ReadPassword` does not take place in a TTY, which results in an error `inappropriate ioctl for device`.\r\n\r\nI'm open to other options as well.",
