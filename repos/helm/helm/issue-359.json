  "body": "Manager's REST API testing coverage is currently at 0%. And this is blocked on some changes that need to be made to the manager package. We need a little bit of refactoring of the top level API to make it easier to test things in isolation (and with mocks). Some reworking of the HTTP handler and the init logic should be good.\n\nAlong the way, I'll also fix the flag parsing code, which is redundant right now. It's in that same block of code.\n\nI'm envisioning doing a pass to make it testable, and then we can backfill the API tests as we go.\n",
