  "body": "Several users have stumbled trying to bootstrap DM. Typically, they run afoul of getting python configured correctly. However, bootstrapping is unnecessary. It's a novelty and fundamentally, we don't need to modify the user's machine to deploy DM. We built the bootstrap initially to get a feeling for how things would work, but it's just as valid, much faster and much less error prone to create the resources for DM in the cluster using a flat kubectl configuration file. So, instead of subjecting first time users to python package installs and running processes locally, we should provide a configuration file to streamline getting started. We should also preserve the bootstrap file and the accompanying instructions as an example.\n",
