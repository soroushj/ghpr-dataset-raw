  "body": "To interact with helm we are importing the `k8s.io/helm/pkg/helm` package. This allows us to build a client that can talk to the tiller and create/update/delete releases. This works great.\r\n\r\nRecently we have been trying to speed up our interactions with the tiller so we added some concurrency on our side. It appears the client that comes as part of the k8s.io/helm/pkg/helm package does not support concurrency. Is this expected behavior?\r\n\r\nI've built a basic example that shows this failing. The code for that is here: https://github.com/nicolerenee/helm-concurrency",
