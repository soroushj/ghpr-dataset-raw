  "body": "I recently discovered over 100 old release ConfigMaps in my `kube-system` namespace. I stumbled upon #2332 which provided a great explanation of why it was happening and how I could prevent it in the future but I'm left wondering why the default for `maxHistory` is unlimited? Allowing infinite growth in the `kube-system` namespace seems like a very strange design decision; I understand they're there to allow for rollbacks but I feel like most people don't need the ability to roll back to a version from 80+ releases ago.\r\n\r\nI think it would be prudent to set a default limit on `maxHistory` to prevent future users from having runaway ConfigMaps and putting the health of their cluster at risk. Even something high like 100 would allow for plenty of selection while rolling back while also preventing infinite growth.",
