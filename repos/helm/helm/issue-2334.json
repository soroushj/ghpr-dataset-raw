  "body": "_I'm not sure exactly where to put this so feel free to close this if an issue is not right forum._\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue to discuss HA tiller. I've encountered a many bugs (which seems to be Tiller specific). These bugs end up crashing Tiller for one reason or the other. This got me thinking: What is the story for HA tiller? `helm init` creates a `Deployment` with one replica. I'm not sure if this is by design or just a missing feature for `--replicas` on helm init. Is the correct answer to this story to just run more replicas and forget about it _or_ is there more to the internal tiller server process to make it more resilient against certain failure modes?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Related background context: https://medium.com/saltside-engineering/our-first-kubernetes-outage-c6b9249cfd3a",
