  "body": "Hello people! Thanks for a great tool in helm!\r\n\r\nAs [the documentation states](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-list), helm will by default sort by release name, and optionally (with the `-d` / `--date` flag) by release date.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**  \r\nI would like to request the ability to sort releases by chart name.\r\n\r\n**Background**  \r\nOur use case, for completeness, is that we have a distributed computing system with ~30 systems. Releasing is a manual process, and when we look to make sure the versions are properly deployed, we use `helm ls` to check the versions.\r\n\r\nSince we release every system (that has been updated) at the same time, sorting by date becomes meaningless to us, as well as sorting by release name. `mewing-billygoat` and `wishful-chinchilla` are most likely meaningless to other developers as well.\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution would be to name the releases, but as the charts are already named meaningfully, this becomes redundant.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking your time to read this.",
