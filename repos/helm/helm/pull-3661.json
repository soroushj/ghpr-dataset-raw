  "body": "When Helm v2.8.2 was released, we made a change to the default connection timeout by supplying a value passed from pkg/helm/environment. This broke support for third party clients relying on pkg/helm because now the default connection timeout is zero. Adding a default 5 second timeout back retains old behaviour, while not breaking backwards compatibility because the connection timeout can still be configured.\r\n\r\ncloses #3658",
