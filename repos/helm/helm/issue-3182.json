  "body": "I'm running into a scenario currently where charts are deploying a lot of replicas with readiness/liveness probes set rather high and the connection is being closed (transport is closed error). \r\n\r\nAm running on AWS so most people would point at it being an ELB issue, however, I do have that set to a good 1 hour; I do have AWS NAT Gateways in play. NAT Gateways do kill a connection after 5 minutes of no activity.\r\n\r\nAdding a keepalive in the GRPC client connection would help here; Was looking at #3129 to build on it potentially but that might not land soon from what I gather.",
