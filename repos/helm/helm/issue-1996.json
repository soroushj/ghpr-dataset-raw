  "body": "Came across this while doing some mad science on directories that are both Helm charts and Javascript modules. [Minimal repro case is here](https://github.com/streamplace/weird-chart-bug). The end result is that Helm successfully deploys a chart and immediately forgets that it did, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> helm install --name test .\r\nNAME:   test\r\nError: getting deployed release \"test\": release: not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does actually create the relevant Deployment object, but it doesn't know anything about the `test` release. I have to manually go in and delete the Deployment with `kubectl`.\r\n\r\nI'm sure the problem is related to the `node_modules` directory -- it contains a zillion files and directories for all of my Javascript dependencies. Potentially I'm exceeding some hidden limit for files allowed within a Helm chart? Obviously I should be putting `node_modules` in `.helmignore`, but presumably Helm should also be doing something more coherent upon this failure case.",
