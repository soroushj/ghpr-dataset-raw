  "body": "The sha256 checksum files on the release page, e.g., <https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.11.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256> have just the checksum. That is OK, but the Linux sha256sum command has the -c option, which allows it to check signatures, which is handy, as it avoids having to manually and visually check the checksum.
