  "body": "This linter rule extracts each template fragment (`{{.*}}`) in a given template file and executes it on it's own to determine if it is empty (`<no value>` or empty).\n\nThis doesn't work if the fragment creates a block (`if`, `else`, `range`), since these cannot be executed independently - the parser expends an `end` fragment. Currently, the linter is designed to ignore the `if` and `else` cases, but ignoring `range` can cause the following issue:\n\n```\n  {{- range .Values.alertmanager.ingress.hosts }}\n    - host: {{ .hostName }}\n  {{- end -}}\n```\n\nIn the above example, `.hostName` is an element within the context of `.Values.alertmanager.ingress.hosts`, however since `{{ .hostName }}` is executed independently, the linter incorrectly reports that this value is empty.\n\nPotential solutions:\n1. Update the linter to correctly deal with control flow\n   \n   This would mean doing the right thing with `if`, `else`, and `range` by ignoring blocks based on conditionals, or changing context within `range` blocks.\n2. Render the whole template and look for keys that are empty, or set to `<no value>`.\n   \n   This would simplify the linter logic, and also correct the conditional flow issues. However, it will be harder for the user to link back a snippet of rendered template to the template fragments that rendered it.\n3. Remove the linter rule\n   \n   It might be simpler to just remove this linter rule, since:\n   1. empty values can be intentional (at least empty string, not `<no value>`\n   2. some empty values might cause issues that could be picked up by the yaml validator or the kubernetes validator anyway\n\ncc @mgoodness @technosophos @migmartri \n",
