  "body": "\"helm serve\" works nicely to serve a helm repository for your local helm charts. First you have to \"helm package yourchartfolder/\" and then you can run \"helm serve\". This copies the chart archive to $HELM_HOME/repository/local and updates  $HELM_HOME/repository/local/index.yaml which you can then access at http://localhost:8879/charts/index.yaml. \n\nHowever the default path http://localhost:8879/charts/ doesn't list any charts. Only the message \"list of charts should be here at some point\". I would assume it should just pipe index.yaml when it is non empty or even when it has no entries.\n",
