  "body": "My team built an artifactory plugin to dynamically generate index.yaml upon deploying charts to an artifactory repo. We noticed that `helm install` would install old chart versions by default, while `helm install --version` would work as intended.\r\n\r\nLooking through source it seems helm is expecting an ordered `index.yaml`. This seems like a brittle assumption, as the index can simply be sorted upon parsing. Submitting a small patch to fix this behavior.",
