  "body": "I don't know if this was ever discussed and it is probably too late to bring it up but here goes, just in case.\r\n\r\n`helm get` and `helm show` accept both an argument (RELEASE_NAME or CHART respectively) or a subcommand.  This can cause conflicts where helm does not know if the argument is a subcommand or a real argument.  For example:\r\n\r\nIf I have a directory named `chart` (which I do), the command `helm show chart` does not work as it thinks the `chart` argument is the subcommand.  So I need to run `helm show ./chart`; if the directory is named something else, such as `mychart`, I do not need to do this.\r\n\r\nAs for `helm get`, if I have the bad idea of naming a release `values` (or `manifest` or `hooks`), then `helm get values` will not work, although I have respected the `helm get [RELEASE_NAME]` format.  There is probably no workaround for this except running all three `helm get` subcommands sequentially, or renaming my release.\r\n\r\nFinally, shell-completion (surprise! :wink:) of a RELEASE_NAME is not possible for `helm get <TAB>` since it is the subcommands that will automatically be suggested.  On the other hand `helm get values <TAB>` currently does provide dynamic suggestions of release names.\r\n\r\nI don't know if these minor hiccups can justify a breaking change at this time.  If so, I think the subcommand `helm get all [RELEASE_NAME]` and `helm show all [CHART]` could be a way to replace the existing format that does not use subcommands.\r\n\r\nI've looked at `kubectl`, and I believe it is careful not to allow such situations.\r\n",
