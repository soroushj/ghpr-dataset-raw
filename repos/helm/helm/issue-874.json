  "body": "## what\n- Introduce the concept of a `Kubernetesfile` that can be included with applications to express how the service is deployed. It would contain the YAML or JSON of kubernetes resources.\n- Support remote dependencies expressed via a `git` URL to a repo containing a top-level `Kubernetesfile`\n## why\n\nAs applications change or evolve, the way they are instantiated may change. For example, new environment variables may be introduced or removed, new command line arguments may be accepted, additional ports exposed, etc. From a maintenance perspective, it would be convenient if the author of the app could keep the `Kubernetesfile` updated as the code evolves rather than try to keep multiple repositories (e.g. external Helm Charts) current. \n\nThis is similar to what the `Dockerfile` expresses for building an application, the `Jenkinsfile` for integrating it with CI/CD pipelines and (once-upon-a-time) the `Vagrantfile` for setting up a local environment. \n## our use-case\n\nWe have a product that is composed of a dozen proprietary micro-services as well as other off-the-shelf components like statsd.  We want to use a repository that maps out the `Chart` for how to deploy our product in our Kubernetes cluster (the way it works now), but we want service owners to \"own\" the definitions of how to deploy their service much the way they \"own\" their `Dockerfiles` for building them. \n\nWe like the way it works now, but would like this alternative approach for including services that we own.\n",
