  "body": "This fixes #6044, in which error parsing is greedily eating too many\r\ncolons, preventing users from using colons in their warning messages to\r\nthe `required` function\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ian Howell <ian.howell0@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nCloses #6044 \r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nI've arbitrarily decided to use the regex `HELM\\[.*\\]HELM`. This should probably be changed to something more unique, but works for a POC.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the `parseTemplateError` has been split into two functions: one for parse errors, the other for execution errors. This lines up with the current usage of the `text/template` package.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [ ] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n",
