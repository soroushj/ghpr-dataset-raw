  "body": "**Feature:**\r\nAbility to install a chart for a different persona to the user calling the Helm CLI or Helm library.\r\n\r\n**Use Case:**\r\nA user logs into a portal that provides the ability to install charts.  The user is assigned to a team, which grants the user access to specific resources on the system:  namespaces, repositories, and charts within the repository.  The user is also assigned a role on the specific team which controls what actions the user may perform, such as a viewer or an editor.\r\n\r\nOn the UI, there is a catalog of charts to which the user has been given access.  The user selects one of the charts, updates the configuration values, and clicks `install`.  The request is sent to a backend processor for installing the chart.  The backend retrieves the user identify from an access token the user was assigned when logging into the portal, and the backend maps the teams to which the user is assigned to a set of groups for the user.\r\n\r\nThe backend service has been given the right to perform [user impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation), and includes the user identity and groups in impersonation headers that are sent to Kubernetes.  Kubernetes validates the backend service and since it is able to impersonate users, accepts the user identity and user groups passed in the impersonation headers.\r\n\r\nThe key is the user does not use the helm library directly but is used instead by the backend service on behalf of the user.",
