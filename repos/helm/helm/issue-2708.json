  "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nCharts do not currently specify which versions of Kubernetes they are compatible with. Providing this mechanism could save time otherwise spent in troubleshooting incompatibilities.  \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd an optional field `k8sVersion` to `Chart.yaml` that allows the chart developer to specify a semver compliant version. Check the chart's semver value against the k8s version at install and upgrade time and exit with an error when incompatibilities are detected. The value could be any valid semver version format including a range of versions.\r\n\r\n```\r\napiVersion: v1\r\ndescription: foo Helm chart for Kubernetes\r\nname: foo\r\nversion: 0.4.2\r\nk8sVersion: >=1.7.1  # example \r\n```\r\nAn error should be returned when attempting to install a chart that is incompatible with the k8s version.\r\n\r\n## Opens\r\n\r\nWill version checking handle enough cases or will some full on individual k8s api checking be required?\r\n\r\n",
