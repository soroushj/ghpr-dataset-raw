  "body": "I'm developing the `rocket.chat` chart.\r\nSo, in the mean time, I'm installing/upgrading it with the relative path.\r\nThis morning, I wanted to update the docker image to latest.\r\n\r\nI got a little warning:\r\n```\r\nWarning: mongodb is in requirements.yaml but not in the charts/ directory!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs usually, I safely ignored the warning. What a mistake this time!\r\nIf you know `helm` better than I do, you already know what happened, it deleted my mongodb... with the attached volume... then I had to restore a snapshot, but still lost some data on the way.\r\n\r\nI was really surprised that a warning had such an unattended effect.\r\n\r\nI'd like to warn other people, and maybe propose to print an error and exit in such a scenario. I don't see any reason why somebody would want to deploy something without the dependencies. Or even worst, remove the dependency and its data during an upgrade.",
