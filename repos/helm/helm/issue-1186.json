  "body": "Currently most charts are using the `fullname` template (https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/pull/48/files#r77064762) to generate a 24-character names for K8S resources using the release name and name of the chart.\n\nThis seems like a good thing to standardise on, and Helm could provide a template function to generate this, or inject a value (in `.Release` or `.Chart`?)\n\nAnother issue with the template, is that template names are global, so charts should really be namespacing template names (e.g. `mariadb.fullname` rather than just `fullname`), otherwise there will be conflicts.\n",
