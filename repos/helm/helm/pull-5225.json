  "body": "**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nDon't delete a resource on upgrade if it is annotated with\r\nhelm.io/resource-policy=keep. This can cause data loss for users if the\r\nannotation is ignored (e.g. for a PVC).\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\n1. As a helm chart maintainer, I want to prevent accidental deletion of users resources, such as persistent volumes - which could be catastrophic.\r\n2. I annotate the PVCs with `helm.io/resource-policy=keep` to ensure helm never removes them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the current implementation, this annotation only works when `helm delete` is run. If the resource is removed from the chart or renamed, helm will ignore the annotation and delete it on a chart upgrade. This is easy to do accidentally. I believe this annotation should apply in any situation where helm might delete the resource, including on upgrades.\r\n\r\nCloses #3673\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\nI don't think this will cause backwards compatibility problems. It might be surprising new behavior though if someone is relying on upgrades/resource renames to delete things with `helm.io/resource-policy=keep` on them (but that seems pretty strange!). An alternative approach would be to add a new resource policy, like `always-keep`.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [ ] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n",
