  "body": "Following up on [this comment](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/1534#issuecomment-396436584) I'd like to propose that `helm get values` should support the `--output` flag similarly to how `helm list` does. Ideally I'd like to be able to grab particular sub-values with the same syntax as kubectl `-o=jsonpath=\"{$.image.tag}\"`, but having feature parity with `helm list` and returning a blob of JSON or YAML makes sense as well.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
