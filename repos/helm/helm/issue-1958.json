  "body": "`helm upgrade` seems to use `patch`. For some use cases, applying patches can fail (e.g., for services, because `clusterIp` is immutable).  Maybe there's a better solution, but at the moment I have to delete and re-install the full release.\r\n\r\n`kubectl apply` has a `--force` option which allows to give up on trying to patch if it fails, destroy and re-create the resource. This would be great if `helm upgrade` could have a flag like this too. \r\n\r\nThis may also require a `--grace-period` parameter as in `kubectl apply`. Seems like https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/pkg/kube/client.go#L244 could be modified to do a bit more like https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubectl/cmd/apply.go#L594. I am not sure if multiple retries like in apply are necessary. Maybe trying once would be enough.\r\n",
