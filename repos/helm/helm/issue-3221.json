  "body": "I have a PR (kubernetes/charts#1719) that uses two subcharts, with a `requirements.yaml` to make it easy to choose whether one or the other is not deployed.  Currently the acceptance test is failing because it does `helm dep up` before trying to install the chart, and with no `repository` line in requirements.yaml `helm dep up` fails.  Declaring the \"local\" repository causes `helm dep up` to fail a la #2887.  I could eliminate the use of `requirements.yaml` but then I'd have to wrap every template in an `{{- if foo.enabled }}` block, which seems inelegant at best.\r\n\r\nIt may seem nonsensical to have the source repo be the `charts` directory but in my case it's the direct result of these constraints:\r\n\r\n* using subcharts\r\n* wanting to allow subcharts to be turned on or off independently\r\n* wanting that to be easy to maintain\r\n\r\nI propose one of the following two fixes:\r\n\r\n* `helm dep up` ignores dependencies that have no repo declared instead of throwing an error\r\n* if `helm dep up` sees a dependency source URL that resolves to the `charts` directory of the installing chart, it does not try to download the dependency but checks that it is already present and meets any declared constraints like version requirements, erroring only if those checks fail.",
