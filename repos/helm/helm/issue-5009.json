  "body": "During the review of the fix for #4524, it was noted that the original structure of the check for the number of templates could be improved - to minimize future errors if the number of templates was changed again. The current code of:\r\n\r\n\tif l := len(c.Templates); l != 7 {\r\n \t\tt.Errorf(\"Expected 6 templates, got %d\", l)\r\n\r\nwould be better if the number of expected templates were stored in a variable and referred to by both the check and the error message.\r\n\r\nIt has also been pointed out that, in fact, the existing error message is incorrect - the number of expected templates is 7, not 6 (proving the point of this issue!).",
