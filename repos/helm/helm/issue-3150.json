Consider this brief chart:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: {{ .Values.volume.name }}\r\n  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}\r\n  annotations:\r\n    \"volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class\": \"{{ .Values.volume.name }}\"\r\n    \"helm.sh/resource-policy\": {{ .Values.volume.resourcePolicy }}\r\nspec:\r\n  accessModes:\r\n    - ReadWriteOnce\r\n  resources:\r\n    requests:\r\n      storage: {{ .Values.volume.storage }}\r\n```\r\nThe `\"helm.sh/resource-policy\"` annotation is what I'm focused on.\r\n\r\nWhen the annotation is set to `keep`, I can install the chart and delete it properly--the volumeclaim is correctly kept, rather than being deleted with the rest of the release.\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the annotation altogether, I can install the chart and delete it properly--the volume claim is correctly deleted with the rest of the release.\r\n\r\nWhen the annotation is set to anything other than `keep` (e.g. `delete`, hard-coded or through .Values), I can install the chart properly, but the delete does not function as expected--the volumeclaim is not deleted with the rest of the release\r\n\r\nI would expect that a value besides keep would not cause the volume to be kept after a delete.
