  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI almost never check the kube-system namespace, but when doing yesterday I noticed Tiller keeps a lot of old state / history around in config maps in its namespace, and never does any cleanup as far as I can see?\r\nThis seems like problems waiting to happen as these will just keep growing, and I don't see any Helm commands to do a purge. \r\nIs there a way we can limit this?
