I'd suggest using envvars as it seems like the primary way to pass contextual settings to plugins today: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/9bc7934f350233fa72a11d2d29065aa78ab62792/pkg/plugin/plugin.go#L218-L225\r\n\r\n---\r\nOutput of `helm version`: helm 3.0.0-beta.1~4\r\nCloud Provider/Platform (AKS, GKE, Minikube etc.): Any\r\n\r\n",
