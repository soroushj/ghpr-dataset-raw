  "body": "Helm downloads are currently served out of a bucket in GKE owned by the Kubernetes people at Google. This is not part of the Kubernetes infra in the CNCF, where Kubernetes is migrating the things to. The bucket is not in the control of the Helm project.\r\n\r\nWe should migrate downloads/assets to a new location run by the Helm project. Two possibilities immediately come to mind:\r\n\r\n1. GitHub Releases\r\n2. An object storage bucket owned by the Helm project and behind custom DNS (e.g., downloads.helm.sh). The custom DNS would allow us to move the backend location later without impacting end users.\r\n\r\nThe pros to using GitHub Releases is that a) they are free to use and b) someone viewing the releases can find all the files. The cons to GitHub Releases are the extra complication in automation uploading the files and in the scripts that need to find the right file to download and install.\r\n\r\nThe pros to a custom storage bucket + DNS is that a) it's in more of our control and b) the scripts we have will be less complicated. The con is cost. But, we could do this on the existing Helm Azure account where we have the room.\r\n\r\nWe've been asked when we can move off the Google managed infrastructure so this is something we need to do.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the alternative path to start using?",
