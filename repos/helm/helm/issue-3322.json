  "body": "## Problem:\r\nAfter installing kolla-kubernetes (a collection of helm charts resulting in many releases) and attempting to do a `helm list` from a remote client I receive the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: grpc: received message larger than max (6645791 vs. 4194304)\r\n```\r\nThis problem does not manifest when performing `helm list` on the server.\r\nCurrently the count of releases is 16 although I presume it also has to do with release size. Each release is composed of multiple sub-charts.\r\n\r\n## Version:\r\n```\r\nClient: &version.Version{SemVer:\"v2.7.2\", GitCommit:\"8478fb4fc723885b155c924d1c8c410b7a9444e6\", GitTreeState:\"clean\"}\r\nServer: &version.Version{SemVer:\"v2.7.2\", GitCommit:\"8478fb4fc723885b155c924d1c8c410b7a9444e6\", GitTreeState:\"clean\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solutions:\r\nShould I look into \"chunking\" the results as to not exceed the maximum or does someone have a better of idea of how to resolve this issue?\r\n  ",
