  "body": "First of all, I would like to thank you all maintainers of Helm. Helm is really great and awesome in many ways.   \ud83d\udc4d   \r\n\r\n------ \r\nCurrently, after an upgrade for a release, Helm update the release description with : \r\n`updatedRelease.Info.Description = \"Upgrade complete\"`\r\n> source : https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/d6da76f3cfe0dae5a01fd5fec29ce7d6f57a1a52/pkg/tiller/release_update.go .   \r\n\r\nWhile this behaviour is fine for most use cases, I suggest that we should enable users to choose their own description, so that the output of `helm history....` in the future may be more informative rather than the hard coded string `Upgrade complete`.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, this also makes the documentation look outdated. Intially, this string was `Upgraded successfully` (https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/helm/helm_history.md). To sum up, my wish is that this string could be more flexible. \r\n",
