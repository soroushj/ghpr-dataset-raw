  "body": "This change fixes some of the assumptions made in #4590. The bug was triggered because environment variables were parsed well before execution (during `settings.AddFlagsTLS`), causing erroneous behaviour at runtime. By re-introducing `environment.Init()`, Helm can properly parse environment variables at the correct time.\r\n\r\nOne change that had to occur in this PR is the fact that we need to call `settings.Init()` each time we call `settings.AddFlagsTLS()`. This is because each command owns its own FlagSet, so we need to parse each flagset to read and propagate the environment variables correctly.\r\n\r\nOne other bug that was missed was the fact that we were maintaining two separate variables for each TLS value. Replacing the older code with the proper `settings` object makes the code much cleaner to read. Additionally, it fixes the issue where setting a flag or environment variable (e.g. `HELM_TLS_ENABLE=true` or `--tls`) would propagate to the `settings` object, but we'd be reading from `tlsEnable`, ignoring the flag/envvar.\r\n\r\nA third, very odd behavioral bug was also missed dating back to when the TLS feature was first introduced. In prior versions of Helm, `helm init` and `addFlagsTLS` both [shared the same variables](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/v2.10.0/cmd/helm/helm.go#L43-L48) for their respective TLS flags(`--tiller-tls` for `helm init`; `--tls` for everything else). Because they shared the same value, `helm init`'s default value [of the empty string](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/v2.10.0/cmd/helm/init.go#L127) won over of `addFlagsTLS`'s [default value of `$HELM_HOME/ca.pem`](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/v2.10.0/cmd/helm/helm.go#L317).\r\n\r\nIn practice, this code path caused the variable to be [expanded to the full path](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/v2.10.0/cmd/helm/helm.go#L283-L285) of `$HELM_HOME/ca.pem` anyways, but it's why I had to add a check in this PR for `$HELM_HOME/ca.pem` in the root command's `PersistentPreRun`. If we find that `settings.TLSCaCertFile == \"$HELM_HOME/ca.pem\"`, we set it to home's default variable to preserve the old behaviour.\r\n\r\nFun fact: the \"bug\" can be recorded all the way back to [v2.3.0 when it was first released](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/v2.3.0/cmd/helm/helm.go):\r\n\r\n```\r\n><> git diff\r\ndiff --git a/cmd/helm/helm.go b/cmd/helm/helm.go\r\nindex 4eee6795..3119015a 100644\r\n--- a/cmd/helm/helm.go\r\n+++ b/cmd/helm/helm.go\r\n@@ -98,6 +98,7 @@ func newRootCmd(out io.Writer) *cobra.Command {\r\n                Long:         globalUsage,\r\n                SilenceUsage: true,\r\n                PersistentPreRun: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {\r\n+                       fmt.Println(\"TLS ca cert file:\", tlsCaCertFile)\r\n                        tlsCaCertFile = os.ExpandEnv(tlsCaCertFile)\r\n                        tlsCertFile = os.ExpandEnv(tlsCertFile)\r\n                        tlsKeyFile = os.ExpandEnv(tlsKeyFile)\r\n><> make\r\n><> ./bin/helm version -c\r\nTLS ca cert file: \r\nClient: &version.Version{SemVer:\"v2.3.0\", GitCommit:\"d83c245fc324117885ed83afc90ac74afed271b4\", GitTreeState:\"dirty\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also added some unit tests that were originally used to verify the work being done in #4651 to ensure this regression doesn't occur again.\r\n\r\ncloses #4660 \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Fisher <matt.fisher@microsoft.com>",
