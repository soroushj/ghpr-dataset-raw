  "body": "Starting November 1, 2020, Docker Hub will impose rate limits based on the originating IP. Since CircleCI runs jobs from a shared pool of IPs, it is highly recommended to use authenticated Docker pulls with Docker Hub to avoid rate limit problems.\r\n\r\nThis configuration will have to be applied to both the `dev-v2` and `master` branches to prevent CI from failing. More information on how to apply authentication to CI jobs can be found here: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images/",
