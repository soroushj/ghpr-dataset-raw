  "body": "We hit a problem creating a release from a somewhat larger chart:\n\n```\n2016-10-19 09:42:22.348992 I | Updating \"v1\" (v1) in storage\n2016-10-19 09:42:22.464534 I | configmaps: update: failed to update: ConfigMap \"v1.v1\" is invalid: data: Too long: must have at most 1048576 characters\n2016-10-19 09:42:22.464583 I | warning: Failed to update release \"v1\": ConfigMap \"v1.v1\" is invalid: data: Too long: must have at most 1048576 characters\n```\n\nA `helm install --dry-run --debug . > manifest` produces a 600 KB file, base64 encoding that file gives a 810KB file.\n\nIt seems the serialised release somehow still gets larger then 1MB hitting the maximum size limit for a ConfigMap.\n\nSome background: We are trying to install a complete openstack as a helm release and therefore have more then the usual handful of specs in the installed chart. The top-level chart package has a gzipped size of 113KB, unpacked its about 2MB.\n\nI understand that this is pushing the limits of what helm is used for at the moment but in general I think the chart is not unreasonable in size.\n\nOne improvement to increase the size limit could be achieved by adding compression to the configmap storage backend. This would increase the practical size limit of release by a factor of 5 easily given that a release contains a lot of repetitive (compressible) data. Would a PR for that considered useful?\n\nAny other ideas to fix our issue (apart from splitting up the release) ?\n",
