  "body": "[Documentation about chart best practices](https://docs.helm.sh/chart_best_practices/#imagepullpolicy) says:\r\n\r\n> The imagePullPolicy should default to an empty value, but allow users to override it:\r\n> `imagePullPolicy: {{ default \"\" .Values.imagePullPolicy | quote }}`\r\n\r\nHowever, the example chart from `helm create` sets `image.pullPolicy` to IfNotPresent, which seems like a much more sensible default value.  Which is correct?  If the docs need updating I'm happy to submit that PR.",
