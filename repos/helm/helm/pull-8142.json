  "body": "\r\n<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n\r\nThis issue closes #1990 by adding a quick test for `matchLabels` or `matchExpressions` in specific Kubernetes kinds. This was a requested feature because so many Helm issues were being filed because of malformed charts. I don't know if this is any longer necessary. If not, we can probably just close-won't-fix #1990.\r\n\r\nBecause a chart with no valid selector is _illegal_, this is an error. It catches `matchLabels` and `matchSelectors` (instead of just `selector`) because the requirement is that one of these two most be present. These are the fields frequently left off by chart authors.\r\n\r\nLike all other chart lints, this does not enforce anything other than that the strings are present.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\nThis change will definitely cause some charts that did not pass before to fail a lint now. However, those charts would have been broken had they been installed.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [ ] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [ ] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nCloses #1990\r\nSigned-off-by: Matt Butcher <matt.butcher@microsoft.com>\r\n",
