  "body": "I just ran into an issue where I failed to install a chart that was using the name of the release to construct a name for the service:\n\n```\nmetadata:\n name: \"{{ printf \"%s-%s\" .Release.Name .Values.Zeppelin.Name | trunc 24 }}\"\n```\n\nDue to the truncation (see https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/examples/nginx/templates/_helpers.tpl#L10), the name that got constructed was `inclined-prawn-zeppelin-` (`.Values.Zeppelin.Name` is `zeppelin-controller`). Kubernetes failed to validate the chart and returned this error:\n\n```\nInvalid value: \"inclined-prawn-zeppelin-\": must match the regex [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)* (e.g. 'example.com')\n```\n\nIs there anything we can do differently to prevent this issue from occasionally happening?\n",
