  "body": "When we set up `values.toml`, we picked TOML because we felt like it was super simple to use. I had done a semi-formal poll of a broad community of developers, and that seemed to bolster the conclusion. So we implemented the values file as TOML.\n\nBut we are getting very strong feedback from the Kubernetes community that they would prefer YAML, since a wide variety of tools already use it. The arguments for YAML, against TOML:\n- The TOML spec is in flux\n- TOML is less familiar to many people\n- We're the only ones using TOML in the immediate Kubernetes community\n- YAML is just as easy to read\n- YAML has broader editor/tooling support\n\nSo this proposal is that we immediately deprecated values.toml in favor of values.yaml\n",
