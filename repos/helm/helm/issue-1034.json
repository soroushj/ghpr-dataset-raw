  "body": "Some applications may display icon files for Helm charts (for example, service catalog and marketplace web UIs). At one point, we had an `icon:` directive in the `Chart.yaml`, but removed it because it was never particularly well-defined. However, there is a clear need to associate icons with charts.\n\nThere are three possibilities for doing this:\n1. Add a `icon: URL` directive in the Chart.yaml file, and require the value to be a URL to a remote resource.\n2. Specify a canonical file name for icons (`icon.svg` or `icon.png`), and suggest that packagers put the icon inside of the chart.\n3. Add an `icon: PATH_OR_URL` directive in Chart.yaml\n\nFor the sake of simplicity and (network) security, I am in favor of option 2. I'd suggest that we support both PNG and SVG formats, and look in the chart root for `icon.svg` or `icon.png`. I suggest that we also provide guidelines on sizing for PNG images.\n\nSince neither Helm nor Tiller directly use images, this would likely be more a matter of documentation than anything else.\n",
