  "body": "I'd like to use helm to deploy sdn plugins such as canal, calico or weave. This would allow much more easily configured sdn's due to helms templating engine. To do so, requires tiller to be running before the sdn.\r\n\r\nDue to the way helm contacts tiller via proxy without using a svc, This seems to work by simply by launching tiller's pod with net=host.\r\n\r\nCan support for that be added as a command line flag to helm init?",
