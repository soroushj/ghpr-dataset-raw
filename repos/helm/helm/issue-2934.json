  "body": "We import the \"github.com/facebookgo/atomicfile\" package in pkg/repo/repo.go which is licensed using the Facebook BSD + Patents license. This license is a Category X license and not compatible with the Apache 2.0 license. (Details at: https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x) \r\n\r\nTo fix this, we should re-write the atomicfile functionality (or use a different package) so that we no longer depend on the \"github.com/facebookgo/atomicfile\" package. Ideally, we also need to ensure that the person doing the re-write is not tainted (has not looked at the facebookgo implementation) in any way, shape, or form, to ensure that no IP violations occur. \r\n",
