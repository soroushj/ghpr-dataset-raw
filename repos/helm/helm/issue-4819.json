  "body": "Output of `helm version`: 2.10\r\n\r\nOutput of `kubectl version`: 1.11\r\n\r\nCloud Provider/Platform (AKS, GKE, Minikube etc.): other / self hosted\r\n\r\nNote: We are using the tiller gRPC endpoint directly rather than helm CLI, but this should be inconsequential to this issue.\r\n\r\nWe are running multiple install/upgrades in parallel, and hit the following error message:\r\n\r\n```grpc._channel._Rendezvous: <_Rendezvous of RPC that terminated with (StatusCode.UNKNOWN, render error in \"drydock/job-ks-user.yaml\": template: drydock/job-ks-user.yaml:21:53: executing \"drydock/job-ks-user.yaml\" at <include \"helm-toolki...>: error calling include: template: maas/charts/helm-toolkit/snippets/_kubernetes_pod_rbac_serviceaccount.tpl:27:19: executing \"helm-toolkit.snippets.kubernetes_pod_rbac_serviceaccount\" at <$envAll.Values.image...>: can't evaluate field active in type interface {})>```\r\n\r\nYou can see that a template in the `drydock` chart is attempting to use one of the templates from a dependency chart, `helm-toolkit`, of the `maas` chart. This is while trying to deploy `drydock` and `maas` in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be that the `currentTemplates` field seen below is shared state between threads, and is not being handled in a thread safe manner.\r\n\r\nIt gets set here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/helm/helm/blob/3f0c6c54049d38e5c86dad1e9475f7dbf783be21/pkg/engine/engine.go#L125\r\n\r\nand used here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/helm/helm/blob/3f0c6c54049d38e5c86dad1e9475f7dbf783be21/pkg/engine/engine.go#L253\r\n\r\nSo if thread 1 gets interrupted between setting and finishing using it, and thread 2 sets it, thread 1 will see thread 2's templates instead of (or maybe in addition to) its own. In our case thread 1 was `drydock` and thread 2 was `maas` it seems.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me why the field is even needed as its value (`tmap`) is already passed to the `render` function here anyway, so why not just use that:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/helm/helm/blob/3f0c6c54049d38e5c86dad1e9475f7dbf783be21/pkg/engine/engine.go#L126\r\n\r\nIf that sounds like a reasonable fix I could put together a PR.",
