  "body": "I'm working on a simple staging system that would benefit from embedding some of helm's functionality. I wanted to try to embed helm so that the user doesn't need to know anything about helm (it'd be an implementation detail that didn't need exposing).\r\n\r\nAs I sat down to pick some pieces out of the client package, I quickly ran into the fact that almost all of the tunnel-to-tiller functionality is private. This makes perfect sense, given the youth of helm and probably not wanting to expose such a thing just yet.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest that we eventually move this into pkg and provide a public interface. In an perfect world, I can:\r\n\r\n- Fire up a tunnel.\r\n- Call the equivalent of a `helm package`, `helm install`, and `helm delete` from my application without having to resort to hacking something up with os/exec.\r\n- Also probably query for releases and their states from my application.\r\n\r\nWe've already got something like this implemented on our own, but realized that we had poorly reinvented helm. Since we are trying to keep this thing as simple as possible, not asking our users to download `kubectl` and `helm` in addition to our client would go a long way towards making a nice experience!\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to write a helm plugin, but I'm not sure that it makes sense to wrap a staging system _in_ helm.
