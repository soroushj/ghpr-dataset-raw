  "body": "When deleting any helm release, it always succeeds, but errors out with:\r\n```\r\nError: deletion completed with 1 error(s): object not found, skipping delete\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe number of errors can vary, but it happens with every delete. When echoing out the file content [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/pkg/tiller/release_server.go#L949) per @technosophos' request, all that it prints out is `# Source: kafka/templates/config.yaml` as though the file is empty. I have validated that all resources are deleted after the command exists",
