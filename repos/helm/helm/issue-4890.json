  "body": "I have read almost all the documentation on Helm website, and as far as I remember there is a lot of different practices in how Helm templates are written. Among one of these aspects, there is indentation.\r\n\r\nThe following PR was merged introducing a new kind of indentation practice, allowing for improved readability through indentation: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/4562\r\n\r\nI created this issue to suggest the indentation practices in the documentation's examples are made more consistent with this new practice.",
