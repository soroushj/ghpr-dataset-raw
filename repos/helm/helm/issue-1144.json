  "body": "When using `helm upgrade` in CI, exit codes are very meaningful.\n\nI think the case where Helm does not detect upgrades should gracefully exit `0` instead of `1` like it [currently does](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/c7182a5a35fbc078eea6b1de3ee9dafc7ef4721a/pkg/kube/client.go#L325). Just because the state in Helm hasn't changed doesn't mean something is wrong. Also, the state in K8S might have changed outside of Helm. This was my use case: I manually deleted an Ingress object and wanted to use Helm to re-create it for me.\n\nThere's no benefit I can think of to failing CI when Helm thinks there are no changes. If you disagree, then my next idea would be to use a unique exit code for this case so that my CI can catch it and ignore it.\n",
