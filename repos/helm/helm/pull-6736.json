  "body": "Re-open of #6655 \r\nFixes #6416 \r\nCaused by #5874\r\n\r\n## What this PR does / why we need it:\r\n\r\nTo make digests include information about Chart.yaml dependencies, not only the lock file, digest calculation is changed to accept both contents. This terminates the `dep build` command if Chart.yaml dependencies have been updated so that `dep up` should be executed properly, to prevent downloading wrong versions or mismatched subcharts.\r\n\r\nNote that previous Helm cannot know whether Chart.yaml dependencies were changed or not since the Chart.lock's digest is calculated by only Chart.lock contents, which don't include information about SemVer ranges and extra dependency fields such as aliases, conditions, and tags. Especially, SemVer can be written as a version range in Chart.yaml, but Chart.lock has the specific, resolved version of that range.\r\n\r\n## Special notes for your reviewer\r\n\r\nThis PR is the re-open version of #6655. I rebased commits from the previous PR and tried to apply @mattfarina's arguments. Let me know if I'm going the wrong way.\r\n\r\n**If applicable:**\r\n\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests",
