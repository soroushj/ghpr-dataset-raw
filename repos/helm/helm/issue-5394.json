  "body": "As of https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5225, [resource policy annotations](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/33589472cf02d8d10e96e06085d95791c0611a75/docs/charts_tips_and_tricks.md#tell-tiller-not-to-delete-a-resource) are respected during upgrades. The logic for testing whether a resource should be deleted is implemented separately in the delete and upgrade cases, however, and leads to differing behaviors.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n| Annotation                        | helm upgrade result | helm delete result |\r\n|-----------------------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| `\"helm.sh/resource-policy\": keep` | kept    | kept   |\r\n| `\"helm.sh/resource-policy\": KEEP` | deleted  | kept   |\r\n| `\"helm.sh/resource-policy\": \"\"`   | deleted  | kept   |\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would be best for upgrade behavior to match the more conservative and long-standing delete behavior.",
