  "body": "The 14 character release name limit was imposed in \r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/1071 due to a problem in many charts truncating names to 24 characters to create valid DNS names for services.\r\n\r\nAs of Kubernetes [v1.4.0-alpha.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v140-alpha3), service names of up to 63 characters are now supported, so the limitation is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nThe only blocker to removing or increasing the release name limit is whether we want to continue supporting < 1.4 for this particular issue. Given it's sporadic and depends on the chart, we may want to delegate dealing with release name truncation to the chart developer. For example, most of the charts in [kubernetes/charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts) state they require > 1.4 with PVC provisioning.\r\n\r\ncc @technosophos @viglesiasce ",
