  "body": "With the move toward RBAC being on by default in more and more cluster installers, the convention seems to have appeared to control RBAC-related templates as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrbac:\r\n  create: [true|false]\r\n  serviceAccountName: [string]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(see e.g. coreos/alb-ingress-controller#146)\r\n\r\nThis is not yet documented in Chart best practices, and it should be.  I'm happy to do the doc PR, but wanted to file an issue first to probe for consensus on whether the default value of `rbac.create` shoulfd be `true` or `false`.  Most charts using this convention seem to be defaulting to `false`, but my own opinion is that it should be `true`, based both on the direction Kubernetes installers are moving (kubeadm apparently turns on RBAC by default since 1.6, and others have done so since even earlier versions) and my own sense that the defaults should be secure unless there's a very good reason not to be.",
