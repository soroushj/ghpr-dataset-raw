  "body": "I wanted to know if there is possibility for Helm install command to ignore existing resource (if already created) if the **helm/resource-policy** is **keep**.\r\n\r\n**Scenario:**\r\n1. I created release with Secret containing random generated password. This Secret is marked as resource-policy: keep\r\n2. I deleted release\r\n3. I do helm install with same release name\r\n4. Install ignores existing secret so that all other services are connected to Secret with old password.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is needed for **PVC**.",
