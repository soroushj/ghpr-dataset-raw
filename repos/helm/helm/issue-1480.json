  "body": "We all know that the version of a package is derived from the `Chart.yaml`. However, if you are wanting to deliver a new chart artifact for each commit pushed to master changing that file is rather cumbersome (modifying a file in CI is dangerous and having to change that file for each commit seems inefficient). \r\n\r\nInstead, it would be very useful to have a `--version` flag which would be part of the `helm package` command. This would allow us to override the value in `Chart.yaml` within a CI environment without mucking up the workspace. ",
