But in case anyone provide multiple chart name to create in `helm create` command. It'll ignore every following `<chart-name>` except first one. Only create first `chart-name`.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n---\r\n```bash\r\nhelm create hello world\r\n```\r\nIf anyone use above command to create two `helm-chart` called `hello` and `world`, then it'll create only first one. `helm create` command will ignore all arguments except first one \r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\n---\r\n- If possible create multiple `helm-chart`.\r\n- Otherwise, give appropriate error/warning message.\r\n\r\n",
