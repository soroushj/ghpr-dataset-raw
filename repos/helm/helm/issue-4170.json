  "body": "We are looking into returning different exit codes in the helm-diff to simplify some CI scenarios (See databus23/helm-diff#54)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that Helm considers any non zero exit codes from the plugin to be an error and will always exit with `1`. We need to be able to return a specific exit code to the caller.\r\n\r\nE.g. we want the `helm diff upgrade` command to return with exit code `2` if no error occurred but some changes were found.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on how this could/should be implemented?\r\n\r\n",
