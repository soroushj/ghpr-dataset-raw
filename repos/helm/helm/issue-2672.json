  "body": "As per the documentation on using requirements.yaml, one can do something along the lines of:\r\n```\r\n# parentchart/requirements.yaml\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - name: subchart\r\n    repository: http://localhost:10191\r\n    version: 0.1.0\r\n```\r\n----\r\nWhen adding a subchart from the official repository: https://github.com/kubernetes/charts\r\n> This is the default repository for Helm and is installed by default. \r\n\r\nThere should be no need for `repository: http://localhost:10191` in this case, since the default repository should be searched. However, not including it leads to an (unhelpful) error: \r\n```\r\nError: no repository definition for . Try 'helm repo add'\r\n```\r\n----\r\nUsing the repository name however:\r\n```\r\n# parentchart/requirements.yaml\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - name: subchart\r\n    repository: stable\r\n    version: 0.1.0\r\n```\r\nalso fails:\r\n```Error: no repository definition for stable. Try 'helm repo add'```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe only option then is to try `helm repo list` and include the URL provided for stable. \r\n```\r\nNAME  \tURL\r\nstable\thttps://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com\r\nlocal \thttp://127.0.0.1:8879/charts\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think this amounts to 2 Feature Requests, and maybe some better documentation/error messaging.\r\nFeature requests:\r\n\r\n1. Install from `default`/`stable` repository if a repository is not provided\r\n1. Use `Name` of repo instead of URL (easier to make one change to update all charts) ",
