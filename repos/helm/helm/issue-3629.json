  "body": "Right now error messages emitted by helm are very noisy and hard to read. Lets take look at a common example where a required parameter was left undefined:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFoo: {{ required \"myfoo is required\" .Values.myfoo }}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# helm template .      \r\nError: render error in \"foo/templates/foo.yaml\": template: foo/templates/foo.yaml:1:8: executing \"foo/templates/foo.yaml\" at <required \"myfoo is r...>: error calling required: myfoo is required\r\n```\r\nIs it really necessary to dump the file name 3 times, with all the extra stuff in between, and then repeat the actual error twice, one of them truncated? I think it would be a lot better to have a simple and concise message like:\r\n\r\n    Error: myfoo is required (foo/templates/foo.yaml:1:8)\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the redundancy, and the need to have to mentally parse through the message to find the actual error.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe `required` use case seems a little special as this is clearly a user error where we don't need to debug anything. However the spammyness exists for other errors as well:\r\n```\r\nFoo: {{ boom }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: parse error in \"foo/templates/foo.yaml\": template: foo/templates/foo.yaml:1: function \"boom\" not defined\r\n```\r\nPerhaps something like this would be better:\r\n```\r\nError: function \"boom\" not defined (template: foo/templates/foo.yaml:1)\r\n```",
