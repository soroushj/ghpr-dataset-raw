  "body": "Helm should show something in `helm version` that notes it was built from a branch. Prior to Helm 3.0, we displayed the version number \"v3.0.0+unreleased\", but that was hard-coded in the internal `version` package and was removed in #6824.\r\n\r\nHowever, it looks as though the Makefile [clears that string from the build metadata](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/1a13366eb0835f26390e3d9eab2f6b7973ee77cd/Makefile#L43-L46) when it's built from a tag, so we should be able to revert #6824 to differentiate between tagged and untagged releases.",
