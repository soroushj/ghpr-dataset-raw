  "body": "With current functionality of _helm install --wait_, it waits until all Pods, PVCs, Services, and minimum number of Pods of a Deployment are in a ready state before marking the release as successful or timeout. \r\nBut it doesn't wait for the DNS allocation in case of ingress. Through kubectl I have to specifically run the following command to wait for its completion:\r\nkubectl get ingress -n <namespace> --watch=true\r\n\r\nIn my opinion _helm install --wait_, should also wait for the ingress DNS allocation to complete.",
