  "body": "If you use the `include` function in a chart, the linter complains about it.\n\nWe need to adapt the linter to load any extra functions from the engine (https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/pkg/engine/engine.go#L107). Currently, it only loads the sprig func map (https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/pkg/lint/rules/template.go#L141). I'm not sure what the best way to do this is, so I'm giving up and passing the baton to @technosophos.\n\nAlso, strangely enough, it doesn't complain about `toYaml`, but that also shouldn't be loaded in the context of checking each individual function since that logic doesn't touch the engine at all. Any ideas where that could be coming from?\n",
