  "body": "The acceptance-tests started failing after #6492 (had to do a git bisect to figure that out).\r\n\r\nThe reason is that it is no longer possible to add the very first repo when starting from an empty environment as shown below:\r\n```\r\n> export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/test/config\r\n> mkdir -p ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}\r\n\r\n> $GOPATH/src/helm.sh/helm/bin/helm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io\r\nError: open /tmp/test/config/helm/repositories.yaml: no such file or directory\r\n\r\n> /bin/rm -rf ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the locking of repository file expects the directory of the `repositories.yaml` file to exist.\r\n\r\nI first thought of ignoring the error if it was a missing file error, but then I thought that the race the locking logic is fixing could also happen if two `helm repo add` try to create the `repositories.yaml` file concurrently.  I don't know how to fix that...\r\n\r\n",
