Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nValidation of manifests in charts was fixed in #5576. But unfortunately this led to a situation where existing releases that doesn't validate can't be updated, even when the issue has been fixed in the new version of the chart (#5640).\r\nI think the root of the problem here is that Helm combines validation and turning yaml manifests into infos into one function. There are many scenarios where turning manifests into infos should succeed, even if a manifest doesn't pass validation.\r\nThis PR adds a new function `Validate` to the KubeClient. This function does validation, but does not return infos. The existing `BuildUnstructured` function returns infos, but it does not do any validation. The `Validate` function is called from the release server to do validation of new charts while the `BuildUnstructured` function is used internally in the Client to turn manifests into infos for delete, update, install...\r\n\r\nFixes #5640 \r\n\r\n@distorhead @bacongobbler \r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [x] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [ ] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [x] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n",
