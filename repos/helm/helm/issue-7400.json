  "body": "While using Helm as a package instead of just using the binary the problem exists that due to the [usage of the global `scheme.Scheme` in `pkg/kube/converter.go` to create versioned objects](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/pkg/kube/converter.go#L40), custom resources added to `scheme.Scheme` by e.g. versioned clients [will make Helm attempt to 3-way-merge patch those resources as they are no longer of type `runtime.Unstructured`](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/pkg/kube/client.go#L373).\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to use a separate `scheme.Scheme`, with only native Kubernetes added to it, to break free from (generated) versioned Kubernetes clients automagically registering their resources to the global `scheme.Scheme`.",
