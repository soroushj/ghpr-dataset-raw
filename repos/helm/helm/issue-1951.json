  "body": "I was doing some testing of Helm under OpenShift and Kube with pod security policy to flush out any assumptions that don't make sense in a multi-tenant environment.  One of the first ones I hit was that it looks like the helm assumes that it can run containers as root on the cluster:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm install stable/redis\r\nError: release eager-jackal failed: error validating \"\": error validating data: mkdir /.kube: permission denied\r\n```\r\n\r\nA restrictive pod security policy (that doesn't allow running as root) will catch this - since I assume tiller doesn't actually need root in the pods it sets up, it might be good to craft the tiller image so that it doesn't assume it is running as UID 0 in the image.  Since tiller will have access to high level credentials, it's also somewhat dangerous that the tiller image expands the code inside its own container (any escape from the template environment will root the cluster).",
