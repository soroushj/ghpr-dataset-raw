  "body": "Some adopters have tried to install from HEAD only to find that `helm install dm` is currently not working at HEAD. More generally, it's best practice to install a release, rather than the bits at HEAD, unless you're working on the code and intend to work with HEAD.\n\nCurrently, however, the README.md says nothing about installing from a release, so users who clone the repository and follow it verbatim run into whatever issues may await them at HEAD, such as the one mentioned above.\n\nWe therefore need to update README.md to point users to the latest release\n",
