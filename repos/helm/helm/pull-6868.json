No alternative solutions have been reached. This is the best solution as discussed at this time. IMO I'd rather have a half-baked solution that works for community members than no solution. Having this in for Helm 3 will reduce friction for adopting Helm 3 in third party tools like the [VSCode Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) and in [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile).\r\n\r\nthis is identical to #6670, just re-opened against `master` after the big branch switch.\r\ncloses #6322\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Fisher <matt.fisher@microsoft.com>",
