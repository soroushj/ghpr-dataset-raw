  "body": "Using `helm upgrade --install` is a nice way to install or upgrade depending on if the release exists. But it looks like there's a bug in the logic; its not handling failed installs. In my case the first install failed; then a subsequent attempt wasn't even made as it crashes out immediately. \r\n\r\nMaybe if the last release failed then `helm upgrade --install` should delete it and install again?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ helm list\r\nNAME           \tREVISION\tUPDATED                 \tSTATUS  \tCHART                         \tNAMESPACE\r\nfoo            \t2       \tWed Jan 17 11:48:08 2018\tFAILED\tsomething-0.0.1                     \tdefault\r\n\r\n$ helm upgrade \"foo\" . --install \r\nError: UPGRADE FAILED: \"foo\" has no deployed releases\r\n```",
