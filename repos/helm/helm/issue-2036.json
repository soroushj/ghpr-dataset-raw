However, it is very desirable to run the `helm lint` validation with the exact same parameters as `helm install/upgrade` will be run on a system.  \r\n\r\nThere are circumstances where a default `values.yaml` file may not be complete by design.   Where it is better to require the define values on the command line via `--set`.   (I will not provide some of the cases here, as it may sidetrack the spirit of this issue).\r\n\r\nAlso, it is generally better to run the new chart automated integration/testing with the same arguments as are used in the actual install/upgrade.   This guarantees that a single version of a Chart is all that is needed, vs a different default `values.yaml` setup specifically for `helm lint`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
