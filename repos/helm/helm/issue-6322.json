  "body": "I am consuming Helm programmatically and sometimes need to issue slightly different command syntax according to whether the user has Helm 2 or Helm 3.  I can try to detect this using `helm version` _but_...\r\n\r\n* On Helm 2, `helm version` attempts to reach Tiller, which is potentially slow.  I can avoid this with `helm version -c` but...\r\n* On Helm 3, `helm version -c` is an error.\r\n* On Helm 2, `helm version --short` returns a string of the form `Client: v2.14.3+g0e7f3b6` (plus server info which can be suppress with `-c`)\r\n* On Helm 3, `helm version --short` returns a string of the form `v3.0.0-beta.2+g26c7338` (no `Client: ` prefix)\r\n\r\nAll this makes detecting v2 vs v3 a bit fiddly.  I could issue `helm version -c` and assume v3 if I get an error, but perhaps it would be nice to continue to support `-c` as a hidden flag and have it force the output to the same format as v2?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
