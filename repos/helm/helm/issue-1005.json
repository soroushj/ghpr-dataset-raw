  "body": "Currently, if you want to add a partial you need to create a helper and define templates:\nFor example:\n\n```\n{{ define \"nginx.vhost\" }}\n    server {\n      location / {\n        proxy_pass http://{{ .Values.address }}\n      }\n    }\n{{ end }}\n```\n\nand then used in a manifest like this:\n\n```\n...\ndata:\n  vhost: |\n    {{ template \"nginx.vhost\" . }}\n```\n\nThis issue is that I have to manually indent in the define block, because template doesn't return a string to pipe to `indent`.\n\nA much easier to use partial system would be to use the files map from #994, so I can create\nvhost.conf:\n\n```\nserver {\n  location / {\n     proxy_pass http://{{ .Values.address }}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand then have:\n\n```\n...\ndata:\n  vhost: |\n    {{ .Files.Get \"files/vhost.conf\" | indent 4 }}\n```\n\nIf we don't want files to be used as partials (it would be strange to have two different ways of using partials), is there a way the output from `template` can be piped to other functions?\n",
