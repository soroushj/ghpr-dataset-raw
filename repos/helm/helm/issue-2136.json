  "body": "## Scenario\r\nI have two `pre-upgrade` hooks that I need to fire in a very particular order. As it is currently implemented the ordering is not guaranteed and my upgrade procedure may not complete. \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n* Add a weight to all hooks (supplied as an integer). \r\n* Tiller will pre-sort all hooks by weight in `ascending` order\r\n* Execute all hooks with the same weight simultaneously \r\n\r\nThis will allow users to supply their weights as a variable in the `values.yaml` file which can be overridden if a conflict arises. This also satisfies the need of allowing a specific execution order of hooks for complicated installation/upgrade processes.  ",
