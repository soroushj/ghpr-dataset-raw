  "body": "In the Helm developer call we discussed the Helm v2 support plan once v3 is released. Given the time table we are looking at there are migration issues for uses due to the holiday shopping season and tax season. We want to try to take that into account.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind here is the proposal once Helm v3.0.0 is released:\r\n\r\n* Helm v2 is supported for bugs for the next 6 months. All new features will be in Helm v3.0.0\r\n* Helm v2 is supported for security fixes only for the 6 months after that\r\n* After the year support for Helm v2 will formally end. The Google Cloud buckets for the charts repositories, Helm client download, and tiller may go away. I would suggest this is likely. They are managed by Google (created prior to the CNCF). We will make tiller available in an alternative location (it can be used with the `--tiller-image` flag on `init`). Helm v2 downloads are already available at https://get.helm.sh as an alternative.\r\n\r\nNote, if there was a method to transfer Google Cloud buckets from one project to another we would consider that but it is not possible. From our statistics we know that there have been numerous people using older Helm versions so we are sensitive to not everyone using the latest releases.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, feedback, or thoughts on this please fee free to share.\r\n\r\n",
