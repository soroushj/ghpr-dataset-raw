  "body": "Helm version: `v2.0.0-alpha.3`\n\n`helm upgrade` command does not update Kubernetes resource.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a release\n2. Update a variable with `helm upgrade -f value`\n3. Compare generated manifest file (`helm get`) with `kubectl get`\n\nExample:\n\n`templates/pod.yml`:\n\n``` yaml\n...\n  containers:\n  - name: \"waiter-{{ .Values.team }}\"\n...\n```\n\nInitially created the release with `helm install --set team=great teest`.\n\nThen updated with helm  `upgrade listening-snake teest -f vv.yml`. Which updated the release to:\n\n``` yaml\nVERSION: 3\nRELEASED: Mon Aug 15 16:36:59 2016\nCHART: teest-0.1.0\nUSER-SUPPLIED VALUES:\nteam: abc\n\nCOMPUTED VALUES:\nName: my-alpine\nteam: abc\n\nHOOKS:\nMANIFEST:\n\n---\n# Source: teest/templates/pod.yml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: \"listening-snake-my-alpine\"\n  labels:\n    # The \"heritage\" label is used to track which tool deployed a given chart.\n    # It is useful for admins who want to see what releases a particular tool\n    # is responsible for.\n    heritage: \"Tiller\"\n    # The \"release\" convention makes it easy to tie a release to all of the\n    # Kubernetes resources that were created as part of that release.\n    release: \"listening-snake\"\n    # This makes it easy to audit chart usage.\n    chart: \"teest-0.1.0\"\n  annotations:\n    \"helm.sh/created\": \"1471293419\"\nspec:\n  # This shows how to use a simple value. This will look for a passed-in value\n  # called restartPolicy. If it is not found, it will use the default value.\n  # Never is a slightly optimized version of the\n  # more conventional syntax: Never\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: \"waiter-abc\"\n```\n\nThe Kubernetes pod resource was never modified by Tiller as it still shows `waiter-great` as container name.\n",
