  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThe team I'm on wanted to not have an unauthenticated gRPC endpoint (that has access to change things) in our K8s cluster. We looked into [enabling TLS](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/securing_installation.md#the-tiller-grpc-endpoint-and-tls), but instead ended up using the Tillerless Helm v2 plugin (https://github.com/rimusz/helm-tiller).\r\n\r\nFWIW, our opinion was we found it more desirable / easier (at least for us) to use the plugin, vs creating `*.tls` certs and setting up a pipeline to manage them (to store them, and create new ones when current ones expire - and this would've been especially cumbersome if we setup a [separate TLS certificate](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/securing_installation.md#best-practices-for-securing-helm-and-tiller) for each endpoint).\r\nAlso, whenever helm v3 comes out, the [proposal](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/helm-v3/000-helm-v3.md) calls for going tiller-less.\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to ask if it would make sense to update [securing_installation.md](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/securing_installation.md) to at least mention the plugin as another (if not the recommended) option (besides enabling TLS) for not having a wide open gRPC endpoint? \r\nIf the answer is yes, I'd be happy to create such a PR to modify `securing_installation.md` - I just wanted to ask first. \r\n(By the way, currently the only place where this repo mentions the \"Tillerless Helm v2\" plugin is [docs/related.md](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/related.md).)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
