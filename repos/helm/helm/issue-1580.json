  "body": "In even the simplest Charts you will have a fairly long \"values.yaml\" file so that users can tune their runtime properties to the fullest. However to correctly deploy an app from a chart you sometimes have to set certain properties. We need a way to define a \"Required\" key/property in values.yaml. \r\n\r\nThis will make it easier to build charts because helm can validate that these properties are set and stop the deployment or warn the user about the missing changes. Today we have to implement the required checks manually with template helpers. \r\n\r\nThis feature will also make it easier to deploy Helm charts through UIs because those UIs can prioritise the properties the end user needs to set above a long list of optional ones.\r\n\r\nA simple example of a current chart that could benefit from this change is stable/minecraft. There is one property that has to be set so that application works and that's the \"EULA\" property. If you do not set that to \"true\" (I agree with the EULA!) then the app will deploy but won't work. The chart maintainer for that had to write template functions to do those checks and write comments for the user using a templated Notes.txt\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could get away with something simple like below. The \"@required\" in the comment above the key would make the following key required to be changed and the string after \":\" would be the message that the user gets if he fails to do so? Just an idea - there is probably a YAML friendly way of doing this...\r\n\r\n```# Minecraft values.yaml...\r\nminecraftServer:\r\n  # @required: This must be overridden, since we can't accept this for the user.\r\n  eula: \"FALSE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we could add a helm cli flag i.e. :\r\n```helm inspect values --required chartname```\r\nThat filters the required keys and shows that to us. Or without the flag the output would mark the required specifically with a \"*\" plus show the required comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
