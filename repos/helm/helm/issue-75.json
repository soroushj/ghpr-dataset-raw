  "body": "The vocabulary currently used by DM is confusing:\n- Configuration files that contain no substitution points are called `templates`.\n- Python or Jinja files that do contain substitution points are called `types`.\n- Kubernetes primitives like Pod, Service and Replication Controller, are called `configurable resource types`. There are no other uses of this term, unlike in DM for GCP.\n\nOn top of this confusion, the term `type` is opaque. Users looking for simple templates might not think to look for types. Everyone knows what a template is. It's a piece of content that contains substitution points. However, a type could be just about anything.\n\nWe need to clean up the terminology, and focus more on making it intuitive to the Kubernetes community than on following the precedents set by DM for GCP.\n",
