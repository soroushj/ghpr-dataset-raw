  "body": "By design, manager decides which expansion service to call by examining the `Expander.Name` property of Chart.yaml. \n\nCurrently, however, it's hard wired to recognize the value `Expandybird`, which it maps to the existing expandybird service. This behavior needs to change to make the property value a service name, which manager looks up using DNS.\n\nNote that when we make this change, we may be bitten by the DNS issue in the alpine:3.3 base image we're using for manager. We should therefore use the existing service lookup code that manager uses to find Expandybird, which checks environment variables first, then falls back to DNS. That way, we will be able to find and call all expansion services started before manager. A bit of a hack, perhaps, but it should suffice for Go template expansion and Jsonnet while we wait for alpine:3.4.\n\nAlso, note that when this change is made, all existing charts whose Chart.yaml `Expander.Name` property contains the value `Expandybird` will break. They will need to change the value to `expandybird-service` to be consumable.\n",
