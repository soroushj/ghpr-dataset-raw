  "body": "<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1. Make sure to read the Contributing Guide before submitting your PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n2. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context.-->\r\n\r\n**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nThere is a race condition in the crd_install hook implementation, where there is a chance a CRD is not yet ready by the time CRs are being created. This is reported in issue #4925. This change makes sure CRDs installed through the crd_install hook reaches the `established` state before the hook is considered complete.\r\n\r\nFixes #4925\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\nUnit-testing code in the kubernetes client is difficult, as the builder/infos is tightly coupled with the API server. I will look into how to improve testing for this part of the codebase, but I would like to separate it from this PR.\r\n\r\n**If applicable**:\r\n- [x] this PR contains documentation\r\n- [x] this PR contains unit tests\r\n- [x] this PR has been tested for backwards compatibility\r\n",
