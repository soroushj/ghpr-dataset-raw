Please describe:\r\n<!-- A description of what the problem is. -->\r\nCurrently, when users do backup with BR, they have to manually adjust the `concurrency` setting, however, TiKV is aware of the CPU resources it can use, so it would be better that TiKV can adjust the concurrency setting automatically according to its resources, e.g., 12 CPUs is set for TiKV Pod in Kubernetes cluster, then during backup, if users do not set concurrency explicitly, TiKV set it to 12.\r\n### Describe the feature you'd like:\r\n<!-- A description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nTiKV can adjust the concurrency setting automatically according to its resources during backup.\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered:\r\n<!-- A description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n### Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy:\r\n<!-- If you can, explain some scenarios how users might use this, or situations in which it would be helpful. Any API designs, mockups, or diagrams are also helpful. -->\r\n",
