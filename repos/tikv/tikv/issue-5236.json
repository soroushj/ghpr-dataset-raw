  "body": "There doesn't seem to be a way to automatically detect when a crate listed in the manifest is unused. Removing unused crates from the build could help compile times, and is just good housekeeping.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation it looks like the new `-Z binary-dep-depinfo` flag, which adds binary dependencies to the makefile rules it outputs as part of the build, can be parsed and compared to the manifest to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nIt might also be worth adding such logging at the `info!` level to rustc itself, using the existing bookkeeping for binary-dep-depinfo - this would probably be an easier approach.",
