  "body": "During my profiling I've noticed that the codegen for tikv-server takes almost as long as the codegen for the tikv lib. Codegen being the time it takes for rustc to emit llvm IR.\r\n\r\nThis is surprising since the tikv-server binary contains very little code.\r\n\r\nMy guess is there's a ton of generics instantiation in the crate, which would be duplicated in the other bins as well, and maybe in the lib.\r\n\r\nMove as much code as reasonable directly into the library and see if that has any effect on the codegen time in tikv-server, and any effect on the overall build time.",
