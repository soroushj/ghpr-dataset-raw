  "body": "1. What version of Rust are you using (`rustc --version`)?\r\nBeta 1.19 and Nightly 1.20 downloaded from - https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-beta-powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\nppc64le, RedHat 7.3\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nBuild tikv using make / make static_release\r\nThe build fails with the following error\r\nerror[E0432]: unresolved import `types::os::arch::c95::*`\r\n   --> /root/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/libc-0.1.12/rust/src/liblibc/lib.rs:100:9\r\n    |\r\n100 | pub use types::os::arch::c95::*;\r\n    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Could not find `arch` in `os`\r\n... ...\r\n\r\n4. Analysis so far:\r\nInitially, I was suspecting that the libc crate is not ported for ppc64le, however, after interacting with the rust community, I found that support for ppc64le is available in the latest version of the libc crate.\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42858\r\n\r\nThey suggest upgrading utime, nix and other tikv dependencies to the latest version for better platform compatibility. \r\n\r\nI am currently trying to understand what all might need to be updated- any pointers/thoughts on this would be of great help - thanks in advance!!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPriya\r\n",
