  "body": "In the case, there are a lot of deletes for a range on the transaction level. Once GCed, it leads to a lot of tombstone marks in rocksdb. It is invisible, but iterating on them does have the same overhead as iterating on visible keys.\r\nSo when batch-get on the GCed keys, it calls `writecf.seek(key)` for each key and needs to iterate over a lot of tombstones for every key internally which hurts performance greatly. Also, coprocessor may suffer the same issue.\r\n\r\nSome possible solution:\r\n- use `prefix_seek` and `prefix_same_as_start`\r\n- set `max-skippable-internal-keys=1` for `writecf.seek(key + ts)`. If it encounters a tombstone, it is enough to ensure the key is deleted at this version(without collapse rollback). So it can abort the seek directly, instead of seeking the next visible key.\r\n- sort the keys of batch-get, and`PointGetter` records the key of the last `writecf.seek()`. If the recorded_key > now_key then now_key must be deleted. So it won't seek the range with lots of tombstones again and again.\r\n- Use rocksdb single delete to relieve(Can't solve it completely)\r\n\r\n",
