  "body": "After the move to RBR for messaging, and discussions with @derekperkins, we're simplifying the messaging API. On the upside, this will support all insert constructs. On the downside, the application has more responsibilities on correctness and features. What is changing:\r\n* time_created and time_scheduled are removed from the list of mandatory columns. They will neither be checked nor be populated. If necessary, the application can add these columns and keep them populated.\r\n* The primary key that used to be (time_scheduled,id) is now just id.\r\n* The unique key on id is not required any more, since the PK covers that.\r\n* time_next remains a nullable column, but it's recommended to default it to 0. Setting it to 0 (or any value < now) will schedule the message for immediate delivery. Previously a 0-value was treated as an acked message. This is not the case any more. This means that one could insert a row without specifying a time_next. The code checks for time_acked to contain a non-null (and non-zero) value to determine that a message was acked.\r\n* The default value for epoch can also be 0, but the code treats null values as 0 also.\r\n* Purging is by time_acked. Consequently, a new index is needed on time_acked.\r\n\r\nHere's an idiomatic message table definition:\r\n```\r\nvar createMessage = `create table vitess_message(\r\n\tid bigint,\r\n\ttime_next bigint default 0,\r\n\tepoch bigint,\r\n\ttime_acked bigint,\r\n\tmessage varchar(128),\r\n\tprimary key(id),\r\n\tindex next_idx(time_next, epoch),\r\n\tindex ack_idx(time_acked))\r\ncomment 'vitess_message,vt_ack_wait=30,vt_purge_after=120,vt_batch_size=1,vt_cache_size=1000,vt_poller_interval=30'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's an idiomatic insert:\r\n```\r\ninsert into vitess_message(id, message) values(1, 'hello world')\r\n```",
