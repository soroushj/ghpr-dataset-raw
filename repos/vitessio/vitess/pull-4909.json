  "body": "Fixes #4821 \r\nThe strategy here is to create a temporary file at the beginning of the restore process that is deleted at the end.\r\nIf the file exists at the beginning of the restore process, we assume that a previous restore failed and skip the checkNoDB check.\r\n\r\nThis requires some other changes:\r\n- don't wait on mysqld if we are retrying a restore\r\n- mysqlctld should initialize mysqld config, but not try to bring it up if it detects an interrupted restore\r\n\r\nIn addition, changes have been made to the code so that terminating a grpc client that started the restore will cause the restore to terminate as well, so effectively we are undo-ing most of #2310.\r\n\r\nThe terminate_restore test has been changed to test the new behavior.\r\nBackup tests had to be re-organized because now we have so many cases that if they are all in one test, it times out.",
