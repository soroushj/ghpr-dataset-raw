  "body": "#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIn the shell script `101_initial_cluster.sh` (and others that follow like `202_customer_tablets.sh` and `302_new_shards.sh` ) there is always a sleep line after starting a tablet:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# start vttablets for keyspace commerce\r\nCELL=zone1 KEYSPACE=commerce UID_BASE=100 \"$script_root/vttablet-up.sh\"\r\nsleep 15\r\n```\r\n15 seconds may either be excessive or perhaps not enough in some environments.\r\n\r\nThere looks to be an attempt to wait in the `vttablet-up.sh` shell script (which starts all `mysqlctl` programs as backgrounded), but it likely fails because these are daemons:\r\n\r\n```\r\n..\r\n# Wait for all mysqld to start up.\r\nwait\r\n..\r\n```\r\n\r\n.. or maybe this is only a wait for the mysqld so the tablet can start, and there should be a second `wait` after tablets are started.\r\n\r\nIdeally though, it should be a check to make sure the tablets are listening for gRPC requests. This would allow the `sleep` calls to be removed.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case(s)\r\n\r\nFixing this will help change the examples to pasteable commands, with no races.",
