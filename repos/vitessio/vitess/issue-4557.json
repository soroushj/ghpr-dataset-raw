  "body": "#### Feature Description\r\nIf a user ever is in a situation where there are no replica's it is currently impossible to take a backup without manually stopping the vttablet. There is a command called ChangeSlaveType, but it will not allow you to change from a MASTER to a REPLICA.  There should be an explicit flag on ChangeSlaveType that allows a user to change the tablet type without restart vttablet. This will then allow a user to set the tablet to REPLICA take a backup then set it back to MASTER without having to stop the tablet.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the Backup command could have a flag ( perhaps `allow_emergency_backup_on_master` ) that will allow it to execute on the master  \r\n\r\n#### Use Case(s)\r\nIf binlogs have been cycles and not suitable backup exists to recover from\r\n",
