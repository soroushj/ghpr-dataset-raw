  "body": "### Feature Description \r\nThis PR adds support for xtrabackup backups through Vitess.\r\nBackups and restores can be executed just as they are today, the vtctl commands don't change.\r\n### Pre-requisites, Supported Versions\r\nA compatible version of xtrabackup (and xbstream if using) must be present in PATH. For MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10, the xtrabackup versions that are allowed are 2.4.x and lower. For MySQL 8.0, it is 8.0.x.\r\nMariaDB 10.3 is not compatible with xtrabackup.\r\n### How to Use\r\nThe change is to vttablet startup. vttablet needs to be told to use xtrabackup instead of the current method (which we are calling builtin), and provided the necessary flags. The vttablet flag is \r\n`-backup_engine_implementation=xtrabackup`\r\n### Features\r\n- Only streaming mode backups are supported right now. \r\n- All 4 currently supported backup storage types will be supported by xtrabackup streaming backups also.\r\n- A MANIFEST file is created along with the backup archive, which can be either tar or xbstream.\r\n- gzip compression and uncompression is supported for xtrabackup just like for the current backups.\r\n### Options\r\nAdditional vttablet flags:\r\n- `-xtrabackup_user`: **Required.** database user to be used for backup\r\n- `-xtrabackup_backup_flags`: Optional. flags to add to the xtrabackup backup command\r\n- `-xtrabackup_stream_mode`: Optional. Valid values are _tar_  and _xbstream_. Defaults to _tar_.\r\n- `-xbstream_flags`: Optional. Passed to xbstream command during restore.\r\nIf additional flags are passed to xtrabackup and xbstream, care must be taken that they match (compress/uncompress, encrypt/decrypt etc.)\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\nBefore we are ready to merge this, we need to \r\n~~move the backup_engine_implementation choice from vttablet to vtctl~~\r\nSee https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/3957#issuecomment-470332898\r\n- [x] use vterrors to wrap errors\r\n- [x] ~~implement a backup user dbConfig~~\r\n- [x] add -xtrabackup_user command line parameter\r\n- [x] add xtrabackup to docker containers\r\n- [x] get tests passing in docker\r\n- [x] functional testing\r\n\r\nFixes #3957 \r\nSigned-off-by: deepthi <deepthi@planetscale.com>\r\n",
