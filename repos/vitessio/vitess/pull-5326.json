  "body": "Fixes #4990 \r\nFixes #3866 \r\nFixes #5358\r\n\r\nI recommend that we merge this after branching Vitess 4.0, since config files can break things.\r\n\r\nThis still requires SBR + only STRICT_TRANS_TABLES - two things I was hoping to eliminate, but are required for now so the test suite can pass.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n* Rely more on auto-inclusion (there was a problem cleaning up the 5.6 file, because many 5.7 systems also included this file. With this turned off, the targeting is more specific.)\r\n* Only sets a setting once (so if it is in global.cnf it won't be in a per-version file and vice versa). This helps with debugging. For example, previously you might remove the line `binlog-format=STATEMENT`, only to find there was another place it was set!\r\n* Stops setting settings to the default value (so if a default value changes to be what was intended in 8.0, I will not put the value in default.cnf. It will be specified in each per-version config except 8.0). This can be important because the meaning or best value for a setting can change (for example MySQL 8.0 should use `utf8mb4` because it is faster. The sort buffer allocates differently through versions.)\r\n* If MySQL 8.0 prefers binlog_expire_logs_seconds, make sure it doesn't set expire_logs_days (causes a warning)\r\n\r\nI have added myself as a `CODEOWNER` for the MySQL configuration files and `mysqlctl/mysqld.go`.\r\n\r\n**Important notes: This moves the worker test to shard 5. Which means it is no longer tested by CI. See comment by Sugu that this is deprecated.**\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Morgan Tocker <tocker@gmail.com>",
