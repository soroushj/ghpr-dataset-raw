  "body": "Fix #4481 \r\nAttempt to undo changes made during reparenting if we encounter a failure in a critical phase (DemoteMaster / PromoteSlave). Once those steps are complete we have reached a point of no return and cannot rollback.\r\nRather than separating the cancel logic into a function, the approach taken here is to rollback as and when we encounter an error. That way we know exactly which steps have to be rolled back, and there are many. The exception is DemoteMaster, for which an Undo function has been implemented.\r\nOne thing that hasn't been done yet is to check the new master's replication lag before going ahead with DemoteMaster. That will be done as a separate PR.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: deepthi <deepthi@planetscale.com>",
