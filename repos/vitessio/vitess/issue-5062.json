If so, it seems we need to fix an interaction between backups and the tablet health check.\r\n\r\nDuring a backup, the health check result is not being updated, perhaps due to the tabletmanager action lock. As a result, /healthz and vtgate start seeing the tablet as unhealthy due to `last health check is too old: 9m24.152112392s > 15s`.",
