  "body": "Sorry if I miss something but I couldn't find anything so I need to ask it here :) The comment for `spanFactory` says (https://github.com/youtube/vitess/blob/master/go/trace/trace.go#L60):\n\n```\n// spanFactory should be changed by a plugin during init() to a factory that\n// creates an actual Span implementation for that plugin's tracing framework.\n```\n\nAs I playing with the `rpcplus` package, the methods of `rpcplus.Client` is calling the following lines (Go method):\n\n```\nspan := trace.NewSpanFromContext(ctx)\nspan.StartClient(serviceMethod)\ndefer span.Finish()\n```\n\nI dig into it and saw that it uses a no-op implementation (fakeSpan). I can't change the Span interface. The `spanFactory` variable is not exported I don't have any access to it. I've searched for the whole git repo and couldn't find any other implementation too. \n\nIs that used? If yes how should we use it? If not can we export it so I have access to it, otherwise it's seems pretty useless for third-party package users. \n",
