  "body": "#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nThe testsuite does a lot of `mysqld --initialize-insecure` steps, which take about 3-4 seconds on my local machine with the testsuite's `default-fast.cnf` configuration file.\r\n\r\nI tried adjusting the config file -- but there don't appear to be any low hanging fruit. The innodb-log-file-size for example is already 4M.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't see a performance improvement by `LD_PRELOAD`'ing libeatmydata in a microbench:\r\n\r\nWithout `LD_PRELOAD`:\r\n```\r\nreal\t0m4.068s\r\nuser\t0m0.543s\r\nsys\t0m0.276s\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libeatmydata.so`:\r\n```\r\nreal\t0m1.971s\r\nuser\t0m0.161s\r\nsys\t0m0.079s\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think tried on an isolated test (backup), and the performance went from 7m1.5s to 6m22s -- so not as big of an improvement to the total profile, but probably still worth doing.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be included in the Docker image, so the test command can change to:\r\n```\r\nexport LD_PRELOAD=\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libeatmydata.so\"\r\n...\r\ngo run test.go $TEST_FLAGS $TEST_MATRIX\r\n```\r\n#### Use Case(s)\r\n\r\nThis helps improve the test case run speed, particularly in cases where there is high io latency, since libeatmydata turns fsync & friends into noops.\r\n\r\nBased on the result of the backup test: we can assume it is a global 10-20% run time improvement. So maybe not worth doing immediately, but has some value.",
