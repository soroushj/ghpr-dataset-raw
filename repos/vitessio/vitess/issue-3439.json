  "body": "I'm following the [guide to get vitess running on Kubernetes](http://vitess.io/getting-started/#start-a-vitess-cluster), and ran into an issue when getting etcd deployed. `etcd-up.sh` kept getting hung up on [this line](https://github.com/youtube/vitess/blob/master/examples/kubernetes/etcd-up.sh#L42).  It's checking if there's a custom resource definition for etcd, which fails every time, causing the script to fail.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be caused by aaafa50667153618b15fb9e72f04ac4d61862bbf, though I haven't done a full bisect to verify that.  Reverting to the commit immediately previous to aaafa50667153618b15fb9e72f04ac4d61862bbf does resolve the issue, however.",
