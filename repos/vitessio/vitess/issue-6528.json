  "body": "#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we had more visibility/metrics around Vitess heartbeat stats. At a lower polling frequencies (eg once per minute), `HeartbeatCurrentLagNs` only provides a glimpse into the current replication lag at a specific poll point. \r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if we had histograms similar to the query timing. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would also be useful if we exposed a counter showing the number of times replication lag exceeded a specific (configurable?) threshold over the last minute, etc. ",
