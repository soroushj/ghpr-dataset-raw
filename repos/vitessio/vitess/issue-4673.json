  "body": "#### Overview of the Issue\r\n\r\nWhile chaos testing at Hubspot we discovered that if the MySql process was killed and restarted for a vttablet replica that the vttablet would never reconnect. After some investigation, we found this was due to the way that healthcheck.go verifies the health. The healthcheck is powered by the [hearbeat reporter](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/vttablet/tabletmanager/healthcheck.go#L200). The heartbeat reporter fetches the latest from the [reader]( https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/092479406b27ae61a8fcd146a0e08af2d51a7245/go/vt/vttablet/heartbeat/reader.go#L137). Which caches either the last value or an error. In the case that MySql becomes unreachable, the QueryService will [shutdown](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/092479406b27ae61a8fcd146a0e08af2d51a7245/go/vt/vttablet/tabletserver/tabletserver.go#L716) and will stop the [reader](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/092479406b27ae61a8fcd146a0e08af2d51a7245/go/vt/vttablet/tabletserver/tabletserver.go#L623). If the reader has received an error on the last query it ran, then it will always return this error until it gets a new reading. But the healthcheck is using this value to determine if the QueryService can be restarted and the heartbeat won\u2019t get a new value until the reader is restarted, which won\u2019t happen until the QueryService is restarted. So, the service never recovers. \r\n\r\n#### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nDeploy a vttablet replica with heartbeat enabled and then kill the mysql process. \r\n",
