It obtains those using ```FindSlaves``` in https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/850574e0f70/go/vt/mysqlctl/replication.go#L274\r\nAlthough that's documented as \"FindSlaves gets IP addresses for all currently connected slaves\", what it does is: run ```show processlist``` on the master, find rows whose Command is like 'Binlog Dump%', and strip off the port from the Host column. Poking around various databases here, the Host column generally has hostnames instead of IP addresses, so that ```GetSlaves``` returns hostnames. As a result, back in validator.go ```tabletIPMap``` does indeed map from IP addresses, so that when comparing ```if tabletIPMap[normalizeIP(slaveAddr)] == nil``` it's always nil, because ```normalizeIP(slaveAddr)``` is a hostname instead of an IP address. I guess that FindSlaves should be fixed to return IP addresses as it is documented.",
