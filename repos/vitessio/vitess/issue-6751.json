  "body": "#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nvtctl should expose a new command, which, given a number of total shards in a keyspace, outputs a list of the hex shard ranges for a keyspace of that size.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u276f vtctlclient ListShardRanges -num_shards 2\r\n[\r\n  \"-80\",\r\n  \"80-\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Use Case(s)\r\n\r\nFrom the vitess slack I've seen at least one other person maintaining a tool like this, and I would imagine that other users of vitess have their own solution to this problem. Providing this in vitess removes an additional tool for all those users to maintain, and guarantees that we're all using the same logic.\r\n",
