  "body": "With `-gateway_implementation=tabletgateway`, I'm seeing the following unexpected behavior relative to what I'm used to with `-gateway_implementation=discoverygateway`:\r\n\r\n1. vtgate no longer watches non-master tablets in remote cells from `-cells_to_watch`, so if one of those tablets is promoted to master, vtgate suddenly cannot see the master. vtgate still sends master-targeted traffic to the old master, which is now a replica, causing errors like this:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   target: main.-.master, used tablet: awsuswest2a1-3503508100 (10.130.6.111): vttablet: rpc error: code = FailedPrecondition desc = invalid tablet type: MASTER, want: REPLICA or []\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. vtgate doesn't seem to notice when new tablets get added in remote cells from `-cells_to_watch` after the vtgate first loads tablets at startup. vtgate only seems to see the new tablets if I restart vtgate after the tablet records are populated.",
