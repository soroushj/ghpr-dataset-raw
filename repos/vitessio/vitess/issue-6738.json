  "body": "#### Overview of the Issue\r\n\r\nWe were executing a reshard from 1 to 2 shards and before the procedure we executed the `ValidateSchemaShard` for the first shard and the schema is complaining about differences between the replicas and the primary.\r\n\r\nIt complains about [extra table named](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/4230e007f8394929fb62ca819ec26b10ce776c47/go/vt/mysqlctl/tmutils/schema.go#L274) and we cannot proceed with the reshard.\r\n\r\nWe executed the following [query](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/3046e4343c29c3dac2b2a335334429d158146e03/go/vt/mysqlctl/schema.go#L161) in both replicas and primary. The tables show in a different order, still we have a setup for running the procedure locally and the tables show in the same order.\r\n\r\nI can't emulate the issue locally.\r\n\r\nWe are using version 6 of vitess and the engine is MariaDB 10.3.20.",
