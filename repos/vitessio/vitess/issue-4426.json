  "body": "#### Overview of the Issue\r\n\r\n(credit to @zmagg for the initial writeup that is ~reproduced here)\r\n\r\nWhen a tablet completes creating a backup it returns to a `SERVING` state without consideration of accrued replication lag. If this value larger than you're comfortable serving in then there is a period of time between completing the backup and detecting a tablet in this unhealthy state where you're serving stale data.\r\n\r\nThe fallout is unnecessarily noisy alerts and potentially serving bad data.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nRoughly:\r\n\r\n1. Begin backup that takes a non trivial period of time\r\n2. Master receives enough writes that replication is slow\r\n3. Observe tablet serving queries during replication while lag > an unhealthy threshold\r\n4. Healthchecks notice unhealthy state and tablet stops serving queries\r\n\r\n#### Log Fragments\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:00:54.948165 tabletserver.go:312] TabletServer state: NOT_SERVING (Not Connected) -> NOT_SERVING (Transitioning)\r\n15:00:54.970844 engine.go:183] Time taken to load the schema: 1.053\u00b5s\r\n15:00:54.973905 tabletserver.go:312] TabletServer state: NOT_SERVING (Transitioning) -> SERVING\r\n15:00:54.973935 updatestreamctl.go:213] Enabling update stream, dbname: vt_byteam\r\n15:00:54.973985 state_change.go:154] Done with post-action state refresh\r\n15:00:54.975066 rpc_server.go:93] TabletManager.Backup(concurrency:4 )(on us_east_1-0100125104 from ): <nil>\r\n15:00:55.977517 healthcheck.go:269] Disabling query service because of health-check failure: reported replication lag: 3049 higher than unhealthy threshold: 300\r\n15:00:55.977543 tabletserver.go:312] TabletServer state: SERVING -> SHUTTING_DOWN (Shutting Down)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Fix\r\n\r\nTablets will transition into `NOT_SERVING` once completing a backup and we'll let health checks determine that it's safe to move them into a serving state when lag < healthy threshold.",
