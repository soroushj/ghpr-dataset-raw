  "body": "There's an acknowledged [upstream MySQL bug](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=83713) that affects at least 5.7 and 8.0 that shows this error when trying to start replication. We encounter it a few times per month.\r\n`Slave failed to initialize relay log info structure from the repository (errno 1872)`\r\n\r\nThis has also been a cause for flaky tests in the past, so we may be experiencing it in CI more often than we know. #3237 \r\n\r\nThere is also a simple solution that should be 100% safe and works almost every time when we apply it manually.\r\n\r\n    reset slave;\r\n    start slave IO_THREAD;\r\n    stop slave IO_THREAD;\r\n    reset slave;\r\n    start slave;\r\n\r\nI'd like for `repairReplication` to attempt that when it encounters this specific error. If nobody is opposed, I'm happy to send in a PR.\r\n\r\n@sjmudd has also experienced this issue and has commented on the linked MySQL bugs.\r\n\r\nHere are the full Vitess logs surrounding the error. \r\n\r\n```\r\nreplication_reporter.go:69] Slave is stopped.
