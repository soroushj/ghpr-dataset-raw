  "body": "#6250 added support float64 durations in the yaml. The change introduced a regression where the heartbeat interval unit was changed to seconds, but the conversion was not correspondingly changed. In other words, a heartbeat of 1s would have resulted in a value of 1000s instead. The net effect is that vttablet would report healthy replicas as heavily lagged.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects only those who enable heartbeats.\r\n\r\nThis regression as merged into https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v6.0.20-20200617.\r\n\r\nWe should work on a fix for this and do another patch release.",
