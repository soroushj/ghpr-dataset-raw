  "body": "### Problem Statement\r\nvtgate uses \"healthcheck\" to decide which tablets to route queries to. The \"health\" of each vttablet is stored by vtgate using a [TabletStatsCache](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/discovery/tablet_stats_cache.go).\r\nChoosing a tablet to execute a query requires going through the [vtgate/resolver](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/vtgate/resolver.go) -> [srvtopo/resolver](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/srvtopo/resolver.go) which returns a list of ResolvedShard structs. But a ResolvedShard doesn't actually tell us which tablet the query should go to. That decision is only made at [execution](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/vtgate/resolver.go#L94) time.\r\n\r\nIn order to choose a tablet, the current implementation requires 3 distinct structures: a healthcheck, a TopologyWatcher and a TabletStatsCache like [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/discovery/tablet_picker.go). This seems like unnecessary complexity.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\nRewrite the code that is used to choose a tablet for execution to be simpler. To start with, instead of the complex mechanism we currently have for keeping track of tablet health, it can be simplified as follows:\r\n- A HealthCheck struct keeps track of all the tablets' health.\r\n- A tabletHealthCheck struct is created when a new tablet is created in topo. It is removed when a tablet is deleted from topo.\r\n- a goroutine which updates tabletHealthCheck periodically based on the results of the StreamHealth RPC\r\n- vtgate's gateway gets the healthy tablets from HealthCheck to make routing decisions.\r\n\r\nAccording to @sougou there are some special failure modes that we need to worry about and handle. To start with, we can build an alternate implementation for tablet health, gated by a flag. Once it reaches parity with the current implementation, it can be made available for general use.",
