Once of the side effects of this is that it shouldn't need to maintain a healthcheck to tablets that exist in a keyspace it can't reach.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Run a vtgate passing `--keyspaces_to_watch`\r\n2. view vtgate logs and observe that there are healthchecks ongoing for keyspaces not listed in the arg above\r\n",
