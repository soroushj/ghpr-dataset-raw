  "body": "Fixes #5800\r\n\r\nThe function hasAnother commit is supposed to separate out events\r\nthat have to be applied in a transaction from events that are\r\napplied as autocommits. But it was not checking for the OTHER\r\nand JOURNAL events. They should not be batched with regular\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nThis caused a bug where a regular transaction occured followed\r\nby an OTHER event. The apply of this event happened assuming\r\nautocommit behavior, but it actually got added to the previous\r\nuncommitted transaction.\r\n\r\nIf the stop position is reached at this point, vplayer exits\r\nbecause it thinks the autocommit happened, and the entire\r\ntransaction gets rolled back, and the stop position ends\r\nup not being actually reached.\r\n\r\nThe copier which expects this behavior will then start applying\r\nthe next set of rows, but they are not consistent with the current\r\nstop position. This will cause the target to go out of sync.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Sugu Sougoumarane <ssougou@gmail.com>",
