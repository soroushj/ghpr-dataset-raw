  "body": "#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nThis was first suggested in https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/2877\r\n\r\n`MYSQL_FLAVOR` currently has the following problems:\r\n- It needs to be specified (leading to more configuration)\r\n- It uses the value `MySQL56` to refer to MySQL5.7 and MySQL 8.0 (`MySQL57` is not a valid value!)\r\n- In MySQL 8.0, features are shipping after GA. A flavor of \"8.0\" is not granular enough to detect future potential capabilities.\r\n\r\nAs a related point, the way that configuration files are included can be problematic (see the comment on https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/4990 about SQL Modes). It would be much easier if there was a major config file per version which is included.  If a value is already the default in MySQL, it should not be in the config file. This helps reduce maintenance.\r\n",
