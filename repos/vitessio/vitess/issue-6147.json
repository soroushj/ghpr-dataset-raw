  "body": "There are situations where the `from` columns of a lookup vindex can be null. Such columns cannot be inserted in the lookup due to the uniqueness constraints of a lookup. There are use cases where such a thing can be a requirement.\r\n\r\nIf the input value of any of the columns is null, we could skip the creation of the lookup row. This does will not cause problems because such rows are not findable through those columns, but they could be found by other criteria (like primary vindex).\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain backward compatibility, we'll introduce this feature behind an additional param to vindex: \"ignore_nulls\". If set, then no lookup row will be created (or deleted) for such owner rows.",
