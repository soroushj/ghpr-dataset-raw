  "body": "The [php-client package](https://packagist.org/packages/vitess/php-client#v2.0.0) depends explicitly on grpc `dev-release-0_13` and as such is several versions behind the current release of grpc (`v1.0.0`).\n\nWould it be possible for this dependency to be updated to use a newer version? There are currently conflicts between protobuf libraries because a dependency of grpc was forked. This can be temporarily \"fixed\" by using this fake repo [pixelfederation/datto-Protobuf-PHP-fake](https://github.com/pixelfederation/datto-Protobuf-PHP-fake) as a composer override, but that solution is error-prone and can cause issues.\n",
