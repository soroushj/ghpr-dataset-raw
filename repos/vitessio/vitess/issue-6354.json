  "body": "In current Vitess, we support I_S passthrough for `SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table1'` in the context of the currently `USE`-ed database.\r\n\r\nHowever, some MySQL introspection/workbench type tools (e.g. DBeaver) use the format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSHOW TABLE STATUS FROM db1 LIKE 'table1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is just passed through by vtgate;  and causes problems because the underlying shard instance knows the database (probably) as `vt_db1`, not `db1`.  We should rewrite this query, since we already virtualize other introspection commands like `SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM db1.table1` (which does work).\r\n\r\nSample error returned from vtgate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql> SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM db1 LIKE 'table1';\r\nERROR 1049 (42000): vtgate: http://localhost:15001/: target: db1.0.master, used tablet: zone1-100 (localhost): vttablet: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = Unknown database 'db1' (errno 1049) (sqlstate 42000) (CallerID: userData1): Sql: \"SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM db1 LIKE 'table1'\", BindVars: {}\r\n```",
