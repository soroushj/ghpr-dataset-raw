Query planning would succeed if one of the left joins were removed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Multi-table unique vindex constraint on left table of left join, two levels of join, simple aggregation\r\n# This should work, but doesn't. If you remove the join with ue2 this works, but for some reason when\r\n# there are two levels of left join instead of just one the query planner fails to realize that all these\r\n# rows must belong to the same shard.\r\n\"select user.id, count(*) from user left join user_extra ue1 on user.id = ue1.user_id left join user_extra ue2 on ue1.user_id = ue2.user_id group by user.id\"\r\n\"unsupported: cross-shard query with aggregates\"\r\n```",
