  "body": "The declarative configuration workflow described in #1702 implies that you can give kubectl apply a set of objects and all changes will be applied. One change that is trickier is to declaratively apply is the deletion of an object when a spec is missing. After all, how does kubectl apply know which objects to delete were previously created by kubectl apply and therefore should be deleted vs created by the system (e.g. pods from a replication controller) or other unrelated users?\n\nThe answer is the kubectl apply annotation itself. We should add a flag (`--prune`?) to kubectl apply which deletes all objects that (1) aren't in the list given to kubectl apply and (2) do have a kubectl apply annotation at `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`.\n\nNote that currently it's hard to give kubectl apply many objects at once but once #19767 and/or #19639 are finished it will be much easier.\n\ncc @kubernetes/sig-config \n",
