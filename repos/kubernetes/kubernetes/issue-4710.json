  "body": "Now that #4126 and #4514 have landed, it should be possible to expose secrets to containers as environment variables.  While this is arguably not the optimal way to consume secrets, it will be important to users taking their first steps into a cloud environment, and we should offer this feature to enable a good experience for users who need it.  For what it's worth, we consider this to be an important use-case for users of [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin).\n\nLet's start with getting all the requirements and challenges on the table:\n1.  How should this be modeled in the API?\n2.  What limits are reasonable to place on secrets exposed to containers this way?  For example, there are different upper limits on aspects of environment variables on different platforms.\n3.  Secrets are not static but environment variables are.  Should the consuming containers be restarted when a secret value changes?\n4.  Should environment variables containing secrets be exposed via `docker inspect`*?\n5.  Environment variables that contain secrets should not be captured by `docker commit`*\n\n*Applies to future equivalencies in other supported container runtimes\n\nOn all aspects of the problem mentioned above, we should take into account possible cross-cuts with:\n1.  Pass pod info to container (#560)\n2.  Dynamic configuration (#1553)\n3.  Sundry other things collected under the downward/upward API aggregator (#386)\n",
