  "body": "/kind bug\r\n\r\nHi\r\nI've posted PR few months ago #39369 - regarding validating against combination of hostPort:protocol:hostIP.\r\nIt seems that something similar is back, this time with Predicates.\r\n\r\nThe issue is in `plugin/pkg/scheduler/algorithm/predicates/predicates.go` in `PodFitsHostPorts:880` - it checks only for ports and not for IPs they listen on.\r\n\r\nI will try to get PR for this but not if it will be soon.\r\n\r\nBasically: one pod SHOULD be able to listen on:\r\n10.1.1.1:8080\r\n10.1.1.2:8080\r\n\r\nright now it gets denied with PodFitsHostPorts error.\r\nIt was working back in 1.5 or whichever release was in February this year. It seems to have been broken around 1.7.0 release based on Git Blame.\r\n\r\nAshley",
