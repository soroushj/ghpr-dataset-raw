  "body": "The scenario is a single replica with an attached EBS. \n\nThe create seems to happen right after the delete not waiting for the pod to be terminated. This results in the two kubelets fighting over the EBS which generally results in AWS becoming unhappy meaning the EBS has to be force detached.\n\nFrom the docs `All existing Pods are killed before new ones are created when .spec.strategy.type==Recreate` I would have thought deployments would wait until the pod is actually killed.\n\nIs this a bug or am i misinterpreting the docs?\n",
