  "body": "The Permit extension point allows running multiple registered permit plugins, if more than one permit plugin returns Wait with a timeout, then we wait for the shortest of the two timeouts.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that the plugins that issue Wait will have logic, likely baked into the plugin itself, that accepts the pod at a later time. \r\n\r\nHowever, different plugins will have different criteria to accept/reject the pod, and given the current API, a plugin could accept the pod while the criteria of another plugin may not be met yet.\r\n\r\nAt the high-level, we need to change the permit API so that an accept is done for a specific plugin, and the pod will be accepted only after all plugins that issued wait get an accept. We also may want to keep adjusting the timeout every time the pod gets accepted by a plugin (start with the smallest timeout, and if the plugin that requested that timeout accepts the pod, we wait for the next smallest timeout minus the time we waited so far...).\r\n\r\nWe will also need to provide an API to check which or how many plugins have not yet accepted a pod, this is to allow plugins like gang scheduling to wait until all other plugins accepted the pod, and only then the gang scheduling plugin accept the pod.\r\n\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling",
