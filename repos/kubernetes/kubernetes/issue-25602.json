  "body": "kube-controller-manager currently has one flag, allocate-node-cidrs, which turns on two controllers:\n1. A controller which assigns a CIDR to every node created\n2. A controller which configures cloud routes for those nodes (on clouds that support this)\n\nHowever I would like to do the CIDR allocation, without setting up the cloud routes.  In particular, AWS has a 50 node limit for cloud routes, so in order to support bigger clusters, I'm pondering setting up a simple complete graph of GRE tunnels between nodes, using a simple controller on each node that watches the nodes and sets up the tunnels.\n\nOne way to separate the two controllers would be to add a flag which turns off cloud route management, but defaults to true.  It would only come in to play when allocate-node-cidrs=true; then setting manage-cloud-routes=false would allow for kube-controller-manager to set podCIDR on nodes, but would not ask the cloud provider configure the routes.\n\n```\nfs.BoolVar(&s.ManageCloudRoutes, \"manage-cloud-routes\", true, \"Should routes for Pod CIDRs be configured on the cloud provider.\")\n```\n\ncc @thockin \n",
