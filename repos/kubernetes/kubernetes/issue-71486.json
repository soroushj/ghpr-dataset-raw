Thanks!-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nIn large clusters, events that trigger rescheduling of the unschedulable pods are frequent. For example, in a cluster with 1000 nodes, node updates, which are often just heartbeats, may happen at an average rate of 100/s. These events trigger rescheduling of unschedulable pods. The scheduler moves unschedulable pods to its active scheduling queue when such events are observed. There are two particularly problematic scenarios:\r\n1. There are high-priority unschedulable pods and preemption does not help make them schedulable. For example, they may have node affinity that cannot be satisfied, or they may have pod affinity to other pods that do not exist. Such high priority pods may go to the head of the active scheduling queue and block everything behind them.\r\n2. There are many pending pods with the same priority, but a number of them are unschedulable. When these unschedulable pods are moved to the active queue, they are expected to go behind other pods in the queue, but since our queue sorts pods by priority and these pods have the same priority, their order is unspecified. The Pop() algorithm of the heap swaps the head of the queue with the tail, effectively causing the heap to act similar to a LIFO. So, pods which are tried recently, go to the head with a high probability and are retried. This starves pods behind them in the queue.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\r\n/kind bug\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n/assign",
