If a user edits the configmap and then addon manager applies the config again, the `data` field gets clobbered.  You just can't have 2 owners of an object like that.\r\n\r\nI think we have a class of addons that we want to assert absolute or near-absolute truth for, and a series that we just want to initialize and let the user own.  We only get away with this for replicas because of sane defaults.\r\n\r\n@mikedanese @MrHohn ",
