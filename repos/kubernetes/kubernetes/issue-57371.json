There're no limitations on the path. It means that any pod can read/write data to the host path. For regular log path, it can be accepted. For corner case that the path have corp root ca files(or this kind of file), it is a risk to have every pod to have write access.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nit would be like host path can be defined as `ReadOnly` or not. For readonly host paths, all pods which have write mount requests are rejected as `not allow to mount readonly path as writable`. For none-readonly white list, the paths can be mounted as usual.\r\n\r\n/cc @kubernetes/sig-auth-feature-requests",
