  "body": "Ref [kubelet-binding.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/e2e-rbac-bindings/kubelet-binding.yaml)\r\n\r\nFrom the comments in the file, it appears that the kubelet role binding is required because its certificate in GKE environments doesn't include it as part of the `system:nodes` group (which has the `system:node` role bound to it as part of rbac bootstrapping). But then, why is it required to give it a powerful role like `cluster-admin`. IIUC, we should do one of the following:\r\n- Change the [role](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/e2e-rbac-bindings/kubelet-binding.yaml#L15) from cluster-admin to system:node\r\n- Create certificate for kubelet in GKE environments which includes it as part of the group system:nodes (and remove the kubelet-binding.yaml)\r\n\r\n@kubernetes/sig-auth-misc @cjcullen @deads2k ",
