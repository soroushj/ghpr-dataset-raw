  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n/kind bug\r\n/sig api-machinery\r\n/kind flake\r\n/priority failing-test\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nAll the tests that rely on creating a CustomResourceDefinition are [flaky](https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-release-master-blocking#gci-gce&width=5&include-filter-by-regex=api-machinery&include-filter-by-regex=custom%20resource) (about 6-7 flakes per day in ci). This is because the test \"AdmissionWebhook Should be able to deny custom resource creation\" creates a validating webhook, called ```deny-crd.k8s.io```, which denies all crd creations. This is an issue for any other test which will create a crd that gets run in parallel with that webhook test, causing them to fail with the message ```failed to create CustomResourceDefinition: admission webhook \"deny-crd.k8s.io\" denied the request: this webhook denies all requests```\r\n\r\nI tried to fix this in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61609#discussion_r178959024 but it didn't work because I used a namespace selector. The tests are still flaky. I think changing the test webhook image to support handling a new \"/crd\" path which would accept and deny crd creations based on their labels would work (instead of a namespace selector since the crds aren't namespaced anyway).",
