  "body": "When running k8s cluster in vagrant and bootstrap it using cluster/ubuntu scripts, I found that pods cannot access each other using flannel ip. After digging into this problem, I found that it is because flannel would look for default interface after start up. Since the default interface (`eth0`, ip is `10.0.2.15` in my case) is a _nat_ interface in vagrant VM, flannel will use `10.0.2.15` as external interface. However, the correct binding should be `eth1`, which is the hostonly network interface, so that I have to modify the `/etc/default/flanneld` like this:\n\n```\nFLANNEL_OPTS=\"-iface=eth1 --etcd-endpoints=http://172.28.128.12:4001\"\n```\n\nI think the `-iface` option should be configurable in config-default.sh.\n",
