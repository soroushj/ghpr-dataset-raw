However, the impact for UDP is more severe due to the lack of a connection timeout.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nIdeally, the initial TCP connection should connect as soon as the NAT rules are inserted.  Failing that, it'd be good to get a timely rejection rather than sending the traffic into a black hole.  \r\n\r\nFlushing the (TCP) conntrack entries for a service IP as described in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48370 may work to fix this.  I also noticed there was an iptables rule that looks like it was designed to help in this case but it only applies in the OUTPUT chain: `-A KUBE-SERVICES -d 10.102.151.4/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment \"default/nginx: has no endpoints\" -m tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable`.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n* send `kube-proxy` a SIGSTOP to pause it\r\n* create server (e.g. nginx) pod\r\n* create client (e.g. busybox) pod\r\n* create service for server pod\r\n* from client, try to `wget` the server via its service\r\n* send `kube-proxy` a SIGCONT\r\n* should have a conntrack entry with orig src/dst = client/service and reply src/dst = service/client; wget should time out\r\n* subsequent wget should return quickly\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.7\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration**:  GCE\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): Linux smc-ubuntu 4.4.0-78-generic #99-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 27 15:29:09 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n- Install tools: kubeadm\r\n- Others:\r\n",
