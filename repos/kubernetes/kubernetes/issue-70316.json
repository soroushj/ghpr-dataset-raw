  "body": "<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->\r\n\r\n**What would you like to be added**:\r\nToday, the scheduler re-processes unschedulable nodes [by moving them to the active queue every time a node is updated in the cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/1df4f8eaf6721d9f52fed35020c044c986755014/pkg/scheduler/factory/factory.go#L986). Node updates are sent by Kubelet frequently (every 10 seconds) and often times they don't change any of the node properties that could potentially make them feasible. We should be smarter about these updates and move pods to the schedulable queue only when certain properties of nodes change that could make them feasible. These properties include node allocatable, node conditions, taints, labels, ....\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\nImproves performance of the scheduler and avoids doing unnecessary attempts to schedule pods. This is particularly helpful when a cluster has a lot of unschedulable pods.\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\r\n/kind feature\r\n\r\nThis is not a feature really. It is performance optimization, but in the absence of such a label, I need to use \"feature\" here.\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling",
