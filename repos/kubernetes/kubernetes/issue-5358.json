  "body": "I was tring to build kubernetes following /kubernetes/build/README.md. But failed for some times. I looked into the error and found it's because I'm behind a proxy. Then I edited the dockerfile under build/build-image/ folder, added some proxy settings into it and solved the problem.\n\nThough it may not be a problem for experienced guys. Would it be better for the beginners to describe these detaied settings in the document? Can I add the proxy settings I found into the doc?\n\nI'm new to kubernetes and need your opinion. \n",
