  "body": "From: jonathanbweeks@gmail.com\n... we experienced a catastrophic failure this morning when our in-house OpenStack cloud team went to upgrade from Juno to Kilo, and the OpenStack API went away for a period. (We are running Kubernetes on top of Openstack for our internal private cloud.)\n\nWe are still trying to completely grok the sequence of events, but from logs and source code inspection (we are on K8s 1.0.1):\n1. The kubelets on each node periodically poll the cloud provider API to get network/IP interface information. When the API went away, this update starting failing, causing them to be marked as \"Not Ready\" by the controller-manager. This would be bad, as it would lead to the scheduler obviously not being able to schedule pods on the affected nodes (eventually all nodes)\n\nHowever, it is exacerbated by:\n1. The controller-manager eventually then ends up evicting (AKA killing) all pods on every \"NotReady\" node after a timeout (which is quickly all nodes in the K8s cluster)\n\nThis means that the entire cluster basically offs itself in a misguided violent purge. (But no one ever expects the Spanish Inquisition).\n\nThis issue was at least partially captured today in the IRC, and a related issue logged here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/13398\n\nNow clearly, Openstack should have an HA API and allow seamless rolling upgrades, but cloud providers will likely have occasional unplanned API downtime, and kubernetes needs to be more tolerant and robust in the face of that (at the very least, not kill all running pods :)\n\nWe looked at various timeout config settings, but there seemed to be non-trivial side-effects to setting them to \"high\" values (we continue to investigate this). As a workaround, we are patching our kubelet to keep posting status even if the cloud provider is unavailable and will submit a pull request.\n",
