  "body": "Our initial understanding is that liveness probe will start to check after readiness probe was succeeded but it turn out not to be like that.\n\nWe are testing with our system that has a long boot time, an approximation of boot time is between 1-3 minutes. We specify readiness probe with same url of liveness probe and specify initial delay of liveness probe to be 30 seconds, we found that the pod is killed by failing of liveness probe while readiness probe still in a failure.\n\nSo, why don't we specify initial delay of liveness probe to be more than 3 minutes? Well, it might be a case when readiness probe succeed at first minute and after that the pod will fail to do a job before liveness probe will start. So, it will affect running service.\n\nAnother point is why we don't only put readiness probe and leave out liveness probe? When readiness probe fail again it might take out of service as well so, it don't cause any affect for running service but it won't be restarted and we have to do manual restart them.\n\nThere are some concerns we thought about, here are list:\n- What if readiness probe never succeed while starting a pod, can we specify a maximum number of check will be performed and if readiness probe fail more than that number, we may consider that pod should be killed.\n- What if someone want to set readiness probe to put the pod in maintenance mode, the pod might be killed by above point if readiness probe fail more than that number or liveness probe will kill it. Maybe, we add one more state of readiness probe called `Maintenance` so that liveness probe should stop working when enter this state and no number of failing readiness probe should not be considered.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",
