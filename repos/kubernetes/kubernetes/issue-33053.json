  "body": "From current [YAML file](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/dns/skydns-rc.yaml.base#L75) for kube-dns addon.\n\nWe are currently using initialDelaySeconds: 30 for readinessProbe for the kubedns container. And [the default state of Readiness before the initial delay is Failure](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pod-states/#container-probes). This setup leads to a huge delay between a backend dns server can serve traffic and it is actually ready. Because these service endpoints would not be exposed and iptables rules would not be injected until readiness probe succeed.\n\nI guess 30 seconds initial delay may be make sense when it is the first dns server backend and it need to wait for the Kubernetes master service to be ready. But it is not desired while scaling out kube-dns, in which we would prefer faster reaction time (it takes around 40 seconds for a dns server being exposed in service now).\n\nWould it be feasible to tune down this initalDelay? Even though probing may fail for a while ahead, I guess it wouldn't hurt a lot.\n\n@thockin @girishkalele @bprashanth \n",
