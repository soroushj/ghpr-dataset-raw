That seems consistent with the GC controller waiting for \"<-gb.informersStarted\"\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): tested with 1.8.2 and 1.8.4\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): vagrant virtualbox with the ubuntu/xenial64 box\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools: kubeadm\r\n- Others:\r\n",
