  "body": "I tried following the \"getting started\" guide on my system (Ubuntu 14.04, vSphere 5.5 w/ vCenter), and hit numerous bugs in the govc module that prevented the vcenter provider from working.\n\nI've raised bugs over at the govc project for these issues:\n- [import.vmdk command](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/issues/204) (can workaround this by manually importing the VMDK)\n- [vm.create command](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/issues/205) (this issue breaks the kube VM startup script)\n\nI could believe that these issues are specific to my topology and this guide is working for others, but I wanted to raise the issues here so that there's a reference to them in this project.\n",
