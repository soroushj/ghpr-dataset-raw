  "body": "/kind bug\r\nUsing https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/local-volume, if a block device is symlinked to the discovery directory e.g. `/mnt/local-storage/block-devices`, then MapVolume will fail with \r\n`volume_path_handler_linux.go:75] Failed device create command for path: /mnt/local-storage/block-devices/vdb exit status 1 losetup: /mnt/local-storage/block-devices/vdb: failed to set up loop device: No such file or directory` since the containerized kubelet cannot see the path on host.\r\n\r\n`/dev` is mounted by containerized kubelet, so if before we try to map the device we set devicePath to the evaluation of symlink `/mnt/local-storage/block-devices/vdb` and end up with a devicePath of `/dev/*`, containerized kubelet will see the device and successfully map the device. Are there any issues with this solution? This is on Kubernetes 1.10\r\n@msau42 @???",
