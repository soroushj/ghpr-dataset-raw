A notable e.g is audit-logging was not turned on for kubemark, but was for real cluster which didn't allow us to catch a serious scalability regression on kubemark (ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/51899). Few other differences:\r\n- admission plugins\r\n- feature gates\r\n- request timeout\r\n- etcd-quorum-read\r\n...\r\n\r\nWe need to fix this.\r\n\r\ncc @kubernetes/sig-scalability-misc @gmarek @wojtek-t ",
