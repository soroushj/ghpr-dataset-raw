  "body": "Hello,\n\nUsing 81054463 and `cluster/images/hyperkube/turnup.sh` gives a nice single node cluster, but Deis v2 alpha can't talk to the apiserver, because it has a wrong certificate ([see](https://github.com/deis/router/issues/62#issuecomment-167843372)). \n\nBy locally vandalizing `make-ca-cert.sh` (or by doing a bit nicer through adding a second argument to make-ca-certs in `setup-files.sh` and adding an env var to `master.json` with the master's IP) can work around this, but the problem is that using `$(hostname -i)` is fragile and will result in 127.0.1.1 with \"host networking\", and at best in a docker 172.17.0.0/16 IP.\n\nHowever, it could be that I (the Deis devs) misunderstood something, and this is a bug in Deis. Or that this is simply an unworkable setup. (Their current config assumes GCE.)\n",
