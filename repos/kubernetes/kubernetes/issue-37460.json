  "body": "In writing some documentation for `kubectl drain` I noticed some issues with the implementation.\r\n\r\nI think the simplest user experience is that the command doesn't return until all the user pods are drained off the machine. In particular this means\r\n* wait until all graceful termination is finished\r\n* infinitely retry evictions that are rejected due to insufficient PodDisruptionBudget\r\n\r\nThe current implementation does not do this, in particular\r\n* wait for graceful termination appears to be [capped](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubectl/cmd/drain.go#L257) at 10 sec * number of pods, which may be much shorter than the max graceful termination\r\n* we only retry evictions [maxPatchRetry](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubectl/cmd/drain.go#L236) number of times\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to change the behavior so that\r\n* we compute how long to wait for graceful termination, by taking max(grace periods of all pods that we want to delete) (or the value of --grace-period command line argument instead, if that is specified), and wait exactly that amount of time plus a small buffer\r\n* we retry evictions infinitely\r\n\r\n@ymqytw @erictune WDYT? I think we should do this in 1.5 because the current behavior is very non-obvious.\r\n\r\n",
