  "body": "Spawned from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/16177\n\n Our `APIInstaller` infrastructure forces all requests for a particular version of a REST endpoint to use an exactly matching version (POSTs to api/v1/namespace/foo/resource must send a v1 object). This breaks the `HPAController` client because it cannot generically include every codec for every (group, kind) that it might want to scale.\n\n// pulling a few comments from the original issue\n1. HPA is a central component that should be able to reach out to generic endpoints\n2. HPA can only know about a limited number of versions and conversions internally (anything compiled with kube)\n3. We want HPA to be able to scale anything that results in pods generically, by virtue of invoking a generic Scale sub resource on endpoints\n4. HPA will therefore have to be able to submit things it knows about to endpoints it does not know about.\n5. Therefore an API server has to be able to accept the things HPA knows about (Scale, Kube group, v1) and convert it internally to its own recognized format (Scale, OpenShift/3rd party group, v2).\n6. Therefore we need to relax the APIInstaller limitation and allow clients to convert.\n   @bgrant0607 @lavalamp i think this walks back the previous decision we had to not accept multiple types of input - there is no way for HPA to scale things it doesn't know about unless it can send things to a remote server that it knows about. The remote server is responsibility for taking the Kube type submitted by HPA and converting it to its own internal format.\n\nThe contract between HPA controller client and remote API groups that implement Scale is \"I will send you one of a set of API versions that I recognize\".\n\n@kubernetes/goog-csi @DirectXMan12 @ncdc @smarterclayton \n",
