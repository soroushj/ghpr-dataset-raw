  "body": "i know that the project is growing like mad, it's still in its early days, and that scalling is always an issue but...\n... regardeless of that i think that there are small steps that could taken to smooth things a lot, and avoid some to feel lost or alienated too fast. \n-  for releases and RCs ship with _real_ release notes, that point at least the new features, or feature/flag/behavioural changes\n- make sure that anytime a new PR gets merged that changes/adds behaviour _shortly_ the docs get updated to match it, as right now there are too much 'assymetry' in the docs as it's very, very hard, (without ending to have to dig in to the source too many times)  to know which specific rev they are targeting/refering to. (heck - i suspect that even the googlebot could get trained to flag/open issues for a good chunck of that ...) \n- as a stop gap it _may_ make sense to, also, add some sort of 'tag' field / header to all docs/examples stating explicitly which version they are last know to work with (we already have that in https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/docs/getting-started-guides/README.md but i would go further and embed that in _every_ doc/examples page/file (as often one lands on them via Google, the Search Engine))\n\nimho gradually implementing those small steps would help a lot a lot of people :smile: \n",
