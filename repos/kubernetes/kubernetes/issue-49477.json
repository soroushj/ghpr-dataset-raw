However, `clearUDPConntrackForPort`(uses the conntrack tool to delete the conntrack entries for the UDP connections specified by the port.) and `deleteUDPConnections`(uses the conntrack tool to delete the conntrack entries for the UDP connections specified by the {origin, dest} IP pair) are remained in `pkg/proxy/iptables.go`.\r\n\r\nI assume move these functions together to `proxy/util/conntrack.go` package can be made them more consitent and we can add some UTs for them in `proxy/util/conntrack_test.go`.\r\n\r\n@thockin @knobunc @bprashanth @kevin-wangzefeng \r\n\r\nDo you agree we may make some benefits from doing that?\r\n\r\n/sig network\r\n\r\n",
