  "body": "/kind feature\r\n\r\nKubelets have TLS certificates that are used to authenticate connections to the API server. With the new `--bootstrap-config` flag and kubelet client certificate rotation, these certificates can now be issued by the API server's Certificate Signing Request API. The `kube-controller-manager` has a flag, `--experimental-cluster-signing-duration` which can be used to change the duration certificates will be signed for. With all of these changes around how certificates are issued and used, it is more likely than ever that certificates in a cluster will expire.\r\n\r\nThere should be a metric which can be monitored to observe when certificates are approaching expiration.\r\n",
