  "body": "The code in #26735 doesn't work for me: `sudo` does not pass on SIGTERM when the caller is in the same process group.\n\nThen the `kill -KILL` knocks out the `sudo` process without giving it a chance to kill its child.\n\nThe `Pdeathsig` bit doesn't help: either the `sudo` process has already been killed as above, or it gets killed now with SIGKILL; either way the `kube-apiserver` process is still running.\n\nOddly, it does work about one time in ten.  I have no explanation for that.\n\nI am running from the command-line like this: `make test-e2e-node FOCUS=Kubelet`, on\n4.2.0-41-generic #48-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 24 11:28:43 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nCC @timstclair\n",
