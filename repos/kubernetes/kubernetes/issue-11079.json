  "body": "They used to look at all pods in the default namespace, which used to contain all of the vital infrastructure pods. The purpose of looking at these was to ensure the system was fully healthy after a reboot, restart, upgrade, etc.\n\nHowever, now I see in the test:\n\n```\nINFO: Wanted all 0 pods to be running and ready. Result: true. Pods: []\n```\n\nI'm guessing this was related to the big namespace change? When moving all of the pods out of the default namespace we must have forgotten to update all of the tests that check the infrastructure pods.\n\nI think this is fairly important because all of these tests are far weaker as a result. (We've caught many bugs in DNS, elasticsearch, kubelet, salt, ... by ensuring pods are running & ready in tests.)\n\nRelatedly, if we switch the minimum here from 0 to 1 in GCE (it was 1 before), we could catch a test regression like this from happening again.\n",
