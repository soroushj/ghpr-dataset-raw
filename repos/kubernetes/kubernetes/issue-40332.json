The load balancer did not complete provisioning and security group was not updated, so the LB that is there doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nAzure load balancer is created, external IP field is populated (doesn't show as \"Pending\")\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\nTry it.\r\n\r\n**Anything else do we need to know**:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue opened against the repo that caused this problem: https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest/issues/112\r\n\r\nThis was reported here: https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/issues/194#issuecomment-274472969\r\n\r\nCC: @codablock @brendandburns ",
