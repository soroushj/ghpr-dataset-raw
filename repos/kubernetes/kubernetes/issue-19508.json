  "body": "Seen when running the kube-proxy as a pod with `NetworkMode == \"host\"`.\n\nThe CNI plugin attempts to retrieve the IP address of the kube-proxy pod, but fails to do so due to the lack of an eth0 interface.\n\n```\nJan 11 22:25:22 node-2 kubelet[877]: E0111 22:25:22.305240     877 manager.go:377] NetworkPlugin cni failed on the status hook for pod 'kube-proxy-172.24.114.32' - invalid CIDR address: Device \"eth0\" does not exist.\n```\n\nI think the plugin interface shouldn't be trying to get the IP address of host networked pods, or if it does it should just be using the node's IP address or some other field, since \"eth0\" won't always exist on a given node.\n\nAdditionally, I've seen the CNI interface call the network plugin setup and teardown hooks for pods with `NetworkMode == \"host\"` - I suspect that this is a bug, and the plugin interface shouldn't be executing network plugins for these pods (since they share host networking).\n",
