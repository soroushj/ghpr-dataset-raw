  "body": "Currently, kuberuntime removes a sandbox only when there are no containers belonging to it. But this introduces a potential problem of removing just-created sandbox, which means a sandbox may be removed if:\n- It has been created and hasn't become ready yet (which means `RunPodSandbox` has been requested and has no response, but the sandbox is already shown in `ListPodSandbox`)\n- garbage collection is run exactly at this time.\n\nThe quick fix is adding age policy to sandbox, e.g. only remove a sandbox if it is older than X. But it doesn't really guarantee this won't happen theoretically (e.g.`RunPodSandbox` takes much longer than gc age).\n\nMaybe full gc policy should also be applied to sandboxes. @yujuhong @Random-Liu @yifan-gu  What do you think?\n\ncc/ @kubernetes/sig-node \n",
