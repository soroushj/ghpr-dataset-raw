Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nI was writing a variant of clock.FakeClock, and noticed a couple of bugs in `func (f *fakeTimer) Stop()`.  Look at the pointer comparison in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c7972d9a5e7f555371fec7a3237f08ebc1ae9d7c/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/clock/clock.go#L298 --- the two pointers will never be equal, but the author clearly expected equality when `i` is the index of the fakeClockWaiter corresponding to the fakeTimer.  The two pointers will never be equal because one is a pointer into the fakeClock's `waiters` slice while the other pointer is to a field of the `fakeTimer`.  The consequence of this bug is that the Stop function is ineffective.\r\n\r\nAlso, https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c7972d9a5e7f555371fec7a3237f08ebc1ae9d7c/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/clock/clock.go#L305 determines the returned value based on the original copy of the waiter, which --- being a copy --- did not get updated if/when the waiter fired.\r\n\r\nNote also that clock_test.go does not exercise FakeClock::NewTimer at all.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI expected FakeClock Timers to work properly.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nUse the TestFakeTimer func introduced in #78808 \r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug):\r\n- Others:\r\n",
