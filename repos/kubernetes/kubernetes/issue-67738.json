  "body": "We recently added an [optimization](66948) that improves performance of checking inter-pod anti-affinity of existing pods. We should apply the same technique to checking affinity and anti-affinity terms of the Pod being scheduled.\r\nThis optimization works by finding all the nodes that can potentially match the inter-pod affinity/anti-affinity terms of a Pod and cache the matching labels of those nodes. We do this once at the beginning of a scheduling cycle. Then when each node feasibility is checked in the scheduling cycle, we only check whether the labels of the node exist in the cache, without processing the affinity/anti-affinity terms for each node.\r\n\r\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n/kind feature\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling",
