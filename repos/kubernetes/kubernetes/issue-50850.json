  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nWe have some cron jobs with longish names (~60 characters), and noticed that the corresponding jobs weren't being created by the cronjob controller because the name was too long.\r\n\r\nHere's what happened: There's a 63-character limit on job names (because for some reason on job creation the name gets copied into a label, where the limit is 63 chars). For example, if I try to create a job with a long name, I get the error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe Job \"100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000000000000010000000000\"\r\n is invalid: spec.template.labels: Invalid value: \r\n\"100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000000000000010000000000\": \r\nmust be no more than 63 characters\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy itself, this is fine. I can just make a job with a shorter name. However! If I create a **cron job**, the cron job controller will create jobs named `$CRON_JOB_NAME-$TIMESTAMP`. So the job's name is 11 characters longer than the job name.\r\n\r\nThis means that if I create a cron job with a 63-character name, it'll result in a job name that's 74 characters, which the API will refuse to accept. This means the cron job never gets scheduled.\r\n\r\nSome possible resolutions:\r\n\r\n1. Add validation on cron job creation that refuses to let you create jobs with names > 52 characters\r\n2. Have the cron job controller truncate cronjobs names\r\n3. Somehow remove the 63-character limit on job names (this seems difficult)\r\n\r\nThere's actually a deeper problem here at play: Kubernetes' resource **name** limit is 253 characters. But the limit for resouce **labels** is 63 characters. So when a job is created, the name (which is allowed to be up to 255 chars) gets copied into a label, which has a lower limit.  So the job creation fails. (these are the [docs on limits](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/identifiers.md))\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nWhen I create a cron job, I expect it to either\r\n\r\n1. refuse to create the cron job, or\r\n2. schedule jobs correctly from that cron job\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n1. Create a cronjob with a name that's more than 52 characters\r\n2. Observe that it does not schedule jobs, with an error message like `spec.template.labels: Invalid value: \"{name}\": must be no more than 63 characters`\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes version: 1.7.3\r\n- Cloud provider: AWS\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- Kernel: 4.4.0\r\n\r\n**example of a job definition with a long name**\r\n\r\nThis job definition is invalid:\r\n\r\n```\r\napiVersion: batch/v1\r\nkind: Job\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: \"100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000000000000010000000000\"\r\nspec:\r\n  template:\r\n    spec:\r\n      containers:\r\n      - name: pi\r\n        image: perl\r\n        command: [\"perl\",  \"-Mbignum=bpi\", \"-wle\", \"print bpi(2000)\"]\r\n      restartPolicy: Never\r\n```",
