  "body": "**What happened**:\r\n\r\nA Pod was scheduled for deletion because a taint w/ effect `NoExecute` was observed in the Node the Pod was assigned to, and after the taint is removed from the Node, the Pod scheduled deletion isn't canceled.\r\n\r\nAfter scheduling pod deletion, the *`NoExecuteTaintManager` only cancels pod deletion if all `NoExecute` taints are removed from the node*, including any taints that the user relies on for their use-cases (example below).\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nAfter the taint that triggered scheduling pod deletion is removed, `NoExecuteTaintManager` cancels the scheduled pod deletion.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n- A node `MyNode` is tainted w/ `OnlyForMyUsage:NoExecute`, so any workloads already assigned to it which don't tolerate this taint are evicted.\r\n- A pod `MyPod` is created w/ tolerations: `OnlyForMyUsage:NoExecute` w/ unspecified `tolerationSeconds` and `NotReady:NoExecute` w/ `tolerationSeconds: 300`.\r\n- `MyPod` is assigned to `MyNode`.\r\n- At some point in time after the previous steps took place, `MyNode` is tainted as `NotReady:NoExecute`.\r\n- `NoExecuteTaintManager` gets an update event for `MyNode` and observes two `NoExecute` taints. It proceeds to calculate the minimum time (in seconds) that `MyPod` tolerates for the two taints which at this point is 300 seconds, and marks `MyPod` for deletion in ~300 seconds - this happens in-memory, in a timed-queue.\r\n- At some point in time after the previous steps took place, and before the 300 seconds trigger happen, `NotReady:NoExecute` taint is removed from `MyNode`.\r\n-  `NoExecuteTaintManager` gets an update event for `MyNode` and observes only one `NoExecute` taint, `OnlyForMyUsage:NoExecute`. It proceeds to calculate the minimum time (in seconds) that `MyPod` tolerates for the this taint which is _infinity_, and returns, not canceling the previous deletion. It *completely ignores the fact that the taint that triggered `MyPod` deletion is no longer observed*.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n- Worked w/ @bobveznat to figure this out after all pods in a node got evicted without apparent reason.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.17.3 (but looking at the code seems to affect all of 1.17.x and 1.18.x and master.\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: N/A\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`): N/A\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): 5.x\r\n- Install tools: N/A\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug): N/A\r\n- Others: N/A\r\n\r\ncc @gmarek @bowei @k82cn (owners of this code)",
