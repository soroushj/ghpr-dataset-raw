  "body": "This feature request is based on https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/26402\n\nWith Issue #23394 (PR #24142) resync was split into resync and relist. This gives informers the ability to set more aggressive ResyncPeriods since resync now just requeues items in the existing cache and does not make expensive network calls to API server to re-fetch all items (relist).\n\nHowever, since shared informers are shared by multiple controllers, changing the existing ResyncPeriod of 12 hours to something more aggressive (1 minute?) would result in a performance hit since all controllers using shared informers would have to handle frequent resyncs, this could be problematic performance wise especially for large clusters.\n\nFeature request: allow consumers of shared informers to be able to either set their own resync periods, or opt in to a faster resync period. That way they get the benefit of using a shared informer, and other consumers of the shared informer do not suffer due to shorter ResyncPeriod.\n",
