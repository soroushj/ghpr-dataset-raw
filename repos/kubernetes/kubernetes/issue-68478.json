  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nthe `gonum.org/v1/gonum` module as a whole depends on `golang.org/x/exp/rand`, which has been introduced after `golang.org/x/exp/inotify` (which we depend on) was retired.\r\n\r\nWe are currently \"lucky\" in the sense that the subset of `gonum.org/v1/gonum` we use actually doesn't depend on `golang.org/x/exp`, so that we get away with using an outdated version of golang.org/x/exp by virtue of the fact that godep doesn't track any of this.\r\n\r\nGo modules are not that forgiving though, and the current situation is not a valid solution to the system of constraints they consider. Therefore this issue blocks a migration to go modules.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nThe dependency graph should be more consistent\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n`inotify` is a can of worms, and past migrations to the maintained `fsnotify` have been repeatedly reverted. It's unclear that there is an easy way out.\r\nArguably the path of least resistance would be to properly fork the old `inotify` codebase into a standalone package, that both `kubelet` and `cadvisor` can depend on without holding back other parts of the dependency graph. Then migration to `fsnotify` can proceed at its own pace.",
