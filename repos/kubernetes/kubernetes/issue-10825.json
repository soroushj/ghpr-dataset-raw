I thought it did, but, from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/pull/10812#issuecomment-119078638:\n\n> The process we use right now is to create the release branch locally, tag it, propose a PR (like this one), then push the branch. Most of those instructions are actually sitting right in mark-new-version.sh, and some are here: https://github.com/zmerlynn/kubernetes/blob/i1883/docs/devel/releasing.md#branching-tagging-and-merging.\n> \n> The problem, and I didn't really think about it long enough when it went in, is that the new sandwich commit you're creating, is always going to get backmerged back like this - git will always try to mutate head from the release version. We take that as good from the release version because we've been trying to keep the head version in sync with the patch version (long story), but not for these cases.\n> \n> We do have a weird cost for merging back and forth between release N-1 and master (we try to keep the release tags merged back to master). Not sure how to crack this particular nut.\n\ncc @eparis @thockin \n\nclosing out #10812.\n",
