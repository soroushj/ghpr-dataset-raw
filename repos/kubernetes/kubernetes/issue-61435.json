Found coredns manifest appears in the addons folder even if it is disabled:\r\n```\r\n# On master node.\r\n$ pwd\r\n/etc/kubernetes/addons/dns\r\n$ ls\r\ncoredns.yaml.in  kube-dns.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nCoredns resources are not created though, probably because `coredns.yaml.in` is a raw template (contains something like `{{ pillar['dns_server'] }}`) that wouldn't pass validation.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nCreate a cluster on HEAD and check `/etc/kubernetes/addons/dns` folder.\r\n\r\n@rajansandeep",
