  "body": "Kubemark, the testing framework for kubernetes, currently has some spaghetti code specific to gce inside the cluster startup script (start-kubemark.sh).\r\nWe would ideally want to have the provider-specific code inside the script independent of the cluster kubernetes logic. The same also applies for config,\r\nwhere we would want different config files for both the components (also with possibly some config that is part of the interface).\r\n\r\nIf we indeed separate these components, how should the interface between them look like? I can think of the following different levels of the interface complexity:\r\n- One where we require the provider-specific component to define methods for fine-grained operations like creation of master-pd, master-https-server, master-ip, master-instance, etc\r\n- One where we worry less about how (or if) we perform these fine-grained operations and rather just require the provider to start the master (with all required components that lets\r\n  it talk to the hollow-nodes).\r\n\r\nAny ideas on which approach is better suited (probably based on experience from kube-up)? The second approach gives more freedom to the provider about how it would\r\nconfigure its components while also (possibly) giving way to more bugs / parts of the kubernetes component failing due to dependencies (which we should eliminate, if any).\r\n\r\n@kubernetes/sig-scalability-misc @wojtek-t @gmarek \r\n",
