  "body": "**What would you like to be added**:\r\nRemove any logic in kube-proxy that tries to automatically clean up proxy rules based on the proxy mode. Only attempt to clean up if `--cleanup` is set.\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\nThis is a continuation of a discussion from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75377. There's a lot of complexity that comes with switching the proxy mode on kube-proxy because it tries to delete proxy rules created from other proxy modes. This has a lot of side-effects and we should be encouraging users to reboot thier nodes along with switching proxy modes. One example of this can be found https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/75360. \r\n",
