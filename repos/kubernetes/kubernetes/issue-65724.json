  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n/kind feature\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nWhen I start the core API server with `requestheader-client-ca-file`, it populates the `extension-apiserver-authentication` ConfigMap in `kube-system` namespace with the requestheader CA. This allows the extension API server to dynamically discover the CA and use it for validating the client certificate of aggregator layer. See [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/apiserver-builder/blob/master/docs/concepts/auth.md) for documentation\r\n\r\nHowever, if the core API server doesn't use certificate based authentication for it's clients i.e. `client-ca-file` flag isn't set in core API server then the extension API server fails to start with error message\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: cluster doesn't provide client-ca-file\r\n```\r\nI believe this is coming from bootstrap code in extension API server [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/options/authentication.go#L243).\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nExtension API server should be able to start and not require that ***both*** `client-ca` and `requestheader-ca` be present in the `extension-apiserver-authentication` ConfigMap. This allows Kubernetes clusters which don't use certificate based authentication for core API server to be able to dynamically discover the requestheader-ca instead of having to mount it as a secret.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n- Create a Kubernetes cluster which uses non certificate based authentication for core API server like Webhook based authentication. Example: You can launch an Amazon EKS cluster which uses Webhook based authentication following steps outlined [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html).\r\n- Setup aggregator layer by adding flags mentioned [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/configure-aggregation-layer/). CA certificate and client certificate for aggregator layer can be generated using `kubeadm alpha phase certs front-proxy-ca` and `kubeadm alpha phase certs front-proxy-client`.\r\n- Deploy metrics server to cluster following steps in Deployment section of README [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server)\r\n- Get logs of metrics server pod and it should be failing with error message above\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nIt's possible there is a reason which is not evident to me as to why extension API server would require both client-ca-file and requestheader-client-ca-file to be present in the ConfigMap.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.10.3\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: Amazon EKS\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Kubernetes control plane and nodes = Amazon Linux 2 (2017.12) LTS Release Candidate (4.14.42).",
