It increases the execution time.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nIf you don't have cfssl in `PATH`, `local-up-cluster.sh` script should download/install it only once and the next execution of script should just use the installed cfssl.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that you don't have `cfssl`\r\n2. Execute `local-up-cluster.sh` script multiple times and observe that `cfssl` is downloaded every time.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nI think that the approach in the following function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/lib/util.sh#L740-L755\r\n\r\ndoes not work and is too complicated. IMO we could just do `go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/...` if `cfssl` is not present in `PATH` and that's all. That script is for developers and it expects to have a working Golang environment, so I don't see any point in fetching OS-specific binary.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): master\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: doesn't matter\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):doesn't matter\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): doesn't matter\r\n- Install tools: local-up-cluster.sh\r\n- Others:\r\n",
