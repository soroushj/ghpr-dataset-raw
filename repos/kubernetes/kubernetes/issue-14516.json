  "body": "The deployment design (#1743) implicitly supports a deployment triggering use case known as \"config change triggering\" in OpenShift: when a new deployment state is observed, the cluster works to realize the new state as soon as possible. There is one functional gap in this design: users sometimes need to temporarily disable a deployment. This could be accomplished by allowing deployments to be \"inert\". Some uses for inert deployments:\n- Provides a way for the deployment to exist in the system awaiting external human processes/validations\n- Provides a safe way to prepare a deployment resource without iterative changes being rolled out\n- A safety switch to prevent a deployment which you don't want to happen\n\nTechnically these use cases are satisfied by simply deleting the deployment resource and recreating it when ready, but that places a burden on the user to preserve the old state until it's ready to be recreated.\n",
