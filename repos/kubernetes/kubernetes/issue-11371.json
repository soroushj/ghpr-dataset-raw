  "body": "At least on AWS, if the clock drifts > 300 seconds (which it will), then we get the rather cryptic message: `AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials`  This is because AWS includes the timestamp in the request.\n\nInstalling ntpd would stop this drifting from happening.  If the drift does happen, the likely symptom is that EC2 calls would stop working: attach/detach volumes on the minions, instance sync and routing configuration on the master.\n\nI don't believe that GCE has the same problem.\n",
