  "body": "**What happened**:\r\n\r\nAn extra scheduling attempt is observed in some scenarios when kube-scheduler already has already assumed a pod and this has entered the binding routine.\r\n\r\nIf, during this time, a pod update is received, the pod is added back to the scheduling queue, even if binding succeeds. This is the correct behavior, as scheduling conditions might change. However this updates could just be unrelated status updates, such as updates to pod conditions.\r\n\r\nWe observe an extra scheduling attempt, which is visible in the log line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError scheduling default/pod-x: pod pod-x is in the cache, so can't be assumed; retrying\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich indicates that an attempt was made when the pod was already scheduled.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nNo extra scheduling attempts\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nThis depends on other controllers running on the cluster that might report pod conditions. One such controller is https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce",
