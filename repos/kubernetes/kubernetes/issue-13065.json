  "body": "The garbage collection strategy has not been well doc (correct me if i'm wrong), which could bother users who have OOD issues badly.\n\nMy main concerns about gc comes to\n- What would kubelet do with the volumes (hostPath, for instance) of the container precisely when it's gonna to remove a exited container. l'll bet It wont please the users whether kubelet cleans the volumes or not. Greater customization should be allowed here. \n- Should warn the users that an external garbage collection tool is not recommended since it would break kubelet's behavior.\n- Since flag like `--maximum-dead-containers-per-container` has been provided to the users, what if we set it to 0? Would kubelet just accept this happily even it could hurt? \n- Is there still race condition (like break the pulling-image-process when gc) existing?\n\n/cc @yujuhong  Seems you had a plan for this, i'm not so sure and just.. ding dong\n",
