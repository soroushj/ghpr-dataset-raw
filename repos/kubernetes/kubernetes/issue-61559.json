They are trying to check that the dashboard is alive, but the dashboard is disabled by default in GKE in Kubernetes 1.10.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nThe test should either not run, or start the dashboard. Ideally, it would start the dashboard so we could see that it works, for now we'll just disable the test.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nhttps://k8s-gubernator.appspot.com/build/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-e2e-gke-regional/5810\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.10\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n\r\ncc @mml @konryd ",
