  "body": "When I kube-up a kubernetes cluster, I find that kube-addons service failed to execute on the master node due the logs below:\n\n```\nApr 07 04:09:39 kubernetes-master-1-6278.example.com kube-addons.sh[8786]: error validating \"STDIN\": error validating data: mkdir .kube: permission denied; if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate=false\nApr 07 04:09:39 kubernetes-master-1-6278.example.com kube-addons.sh[8786]: == Failed to start /etc/kubernetes/addons/namespace.yaml in namespace  at 2016-04-07T04:09:39+0000. xx tries remaining. ==\n```\n\nIt shows the `mkdir .kube` failed due to the permission denied. After a search here, I see this one is very related: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17340\n\nAnd the last comment mentioned it is fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/14087.\n\nBut cases become a little different for a systemd service, since `os.Getenv('HOME')` would return an empty which causes the schema is written to `/.kube` and unluckily, on some OS, a dir creation on root dir is not allowed, Atomic as an example(by default it is now allowed, needs to hack by `chattr -i /`).\n\nso I would suggest to add an environment variable entry in the kube-addons.service.\n\ncc @mikedanese @bgrant0607 @brendandburns and cc @chengyli who helps me find the root cause.\n",
