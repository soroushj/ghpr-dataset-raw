  "body": "Background: I've implemented most of the multi-architecture Kubernetes has today, and wrote the proposal here: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/design-proposals/multi-platform.md\r\n\r\nNow it's time to continue improving the multi-arch experience as well.\r\nTasks to do:\r\n - Deprecate `armel` and use `armhf` images instead and use `GOARM=7` instead of `GOARM=6`\r\n   - Motivation:\r\n     - The only `GOARM=6` board Go will support in go1.8 is the Raspberry Pi 1 which is just too slow to run newer Kubernetes versions.\r\n     - Small performance improvements when using `GOARM=7`\r\n     - The `armel` (http://hub.docker.com/u/armel) images are not updated as often as the  `armhf` (http://hub.docker.com/u/armhf) images are.\r\n - Use go1.8 as fast as possible for arm and ppc64le (and of course generally as well, but that will require the \"real\" release)\r\n   - Motivation:\r\n      - Brings us a lot of mandatory fixes for arm and ppc64le\r\n      - Brings us the SSA backend which is ~30% faster\r\n      - We can remove the patched golang for arm and start building ppc64le binaries by default again\r\n      - arm hyperkube will start working again\r\n      - Even if it's beta, it's probably better than a self-patched version of go1.7\r\n   - Proposal:\r\n      - Use `go1.8-beta1` for the arm builds already in the v1.5 release cc @saad-ali @pwittrock @jessfraz \r\n  - Reenable ppc64le builds again by using go1.8betas until the stable version of go1.8 is released and release v1.6 of kubernetes for ppc64le with go1.8\r\n  - Evalute `s390x` as a new platform\r\n    - If no one loudly complains, I'm gonna take care of the PRs https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37092 and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36050 and merge them in time for v1.6\r\n - Convert the essential images that are named `registry/binary:version` to manifest lists\r\n   - TODO: Investigate rkt support for manifest lists: https://github.com/appc/docker2aci/issues/193\r\n   - Wait for gcr.io to roll out a v2 schema 2 registry that support manifest lists. @aronchick told me it's gonna happen mid-December.\r\n   - Start building manifest lists when releasing Kubernetes (kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, etc.)\r\n   - Basically, all images will be named `registry/binary-arch:version` as most of them are now, but then the image _without_ the `-arch` bit will be a manifest list which points to the right `-arch` image depending on which arch docker runs on.\r\n   - Convert all other essential images to manifest lists, namely:\r\n     - etcd\r\n     - all kube-dns images\r\n     - the dashboard image\r\n     - all heapster images: first step: https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/pull/1387\r\n - Convert the ingress images to multiple architectures\r\n\r\ncc-ing involved people here: \r\n@kubernetes/sig-testing @david-mcmahon @saad-ali @pwittrock @pensu @ixdy @jessfraz @thockin @vishh @gajju26 @brendandburns ",
