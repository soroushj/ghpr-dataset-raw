  "body": "PetSets currently support an annotation `pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/initialized` in their PodTemplateSpec field. From the user documentation:\n\n> annotations:\n>   pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/initialized: \"true\"\n> This field is a debugging hook. It pauses any scale up/down operations on the entire PetSet. If you\u2019d like to pause a petset after each pet, set it to false in the template, wait for each pet to come up, verify it has initialized correctly, and then set it to true using kubectl edit on the pet (setting it to false on any pet is enough to pause the PetSet). If you don\u2019t need it, create the PetSet with it set to true as shown. This is surprisingly useful in debugging bootstrapping race conditions. \n#### Use cases\n1. **Debugging**: If one want to bring up the pets in my petset one after the other, while pausing after each step, confirming that the state is as expected, one may use this functionality. For example, a petset where each pet is a replica of a distributed database; we set the pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/initialized to `false` in the petset template initially. This leads to the following progression:\n   - _PetSetController creates pet-0_\n   - Manually intervene and check that it has initialized as expected.\n   - Set annotation to true (equivalent to marking that pet as healthy)\n   - _PetSetController creates pet-1_\n   - Manually intervene and check that it has initialized as expected.\n   - ...\n2. **Blocking the PetSet controller**: \n   - We may want to ensure that the petset controller is not performing scale operations when a different user-initiated action is in progress (for example, where pets are leaving due to a kubectl drain).\n   - This may be used as a mechanism to orphan a pod from a petset controller (for a closer look), while ensuring that a replacement is not created.\n## Beta plans\n\nThe use case 1 above can be realized using `kubectl scale` and is probably easier to do that way rather than use the annotation. I don't see a reason to have that case supported when we can have users scale up a PetSet gradually and manually in an identical manner. It may have been of more importance before v1.4 when the scaler & reaper were not implemented.\n\nDue to the second use-case, if it would make sense to continue to have this ability, I propose that we move it from the PodTemplateSpec to the PetSetSpec, where it will eventually reside. This seems to me, like the logical place for such a debug hook to reside. In order to run/pause the scaling operations of the PetSet controller, we could have annotations along the lines of `stopSync: true/false` with the annotation defaulting to `false` when absent.\n\n/cc @erictune @kubernetes/sig-apps @smarterclayton \n",
