  "body": "Problem:\r\n\r\nIf a node has RBD volumes mounted and you reboot or shutdown the node, the node may forever be stuck on trying to unmount the volumes because by default network is brought down before volumes could be unmounted. We want these volumes to be unmounted before network is shutdown.\r\n\r\nA workaround for this is, to use `_netdev` mount option, which instructs systemd to create dependncy between mount and network. But `_netdev` mount option is not copied to bind mounts and hence bind mount still can get stuck when the node is shutting down.\r\n\r\n/sig storage\r\n",
