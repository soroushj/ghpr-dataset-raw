  "body": "As of Kubernetes 1.11, [Pod priority and preemption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/) is a beta feature. In the existing version, any Pod could possibly preempt other Pods if it has higher priority than the preemption victims and the cluster does not have enough capacity to run it.\r\nWe would like to add a new feature that allows certain PriorityClasses to be defined as non-preempting priority. When a Pod has non-preempting priority, it won't cause preemption when the cluster does not have capacity to run it, but it is still ordered by its priority in the scheduling queue. So, it has a higher chance of getting scheduled than other pending pods with lower priority.\r\n\r\nOne common use-case for such non-preempting priorities is batch processing. Typical batch jobs run to completion (as opposed to services that keep running). In batch processing, if preemption happens, all the work done by the preemption victim will be lost. As a result, it is often not desired to preempt the existing workload, but priority is still needed to ensure that when new workloads are created those with higher priority go in front the queue and are scheduled ahead of other lower priority workloads when the cluster has more free resources, for example, after currently running workloads are finished.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\nWe can add a new field, called `non-preempting` to [PriorityClass](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/7749eeaf3f1eddd0796a4d61e545a90e7d9d59b0/staging/src/k8s.io/api/scheduling/v1beta1/types.go#L29). When a pod is unschedulable, the scheduler checks this field of its corresponding PriorityClass and starts the preemption process when the field is empty or false. Several points to be considered:\r\n1. All PriorityClasses are considered `preempting` by default. If the filed is missing, the PriorityClass is a preempting one.\r\n2.  A PriorityClass may be deleted after Pod creation. If scheduler cannot find the PriorityClass of a Pod, it assumes that it has `preempting` priority.\r\n3. A Pod may not have any PriorityClass. In that case, its priority is resolved to a defined or implicit default priority. When a Pod priority class is empty, its priority is considered as `preempting`.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the above rules: \"A Pod has `preempting` priority, unless its PriorityClass is found and the `non-preempting` field of the PriorityClass is set to true\".\r\n\r\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n/kind feature\r\n\r\n/ref #64843\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n",
