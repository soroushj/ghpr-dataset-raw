  "body": "Same as an issue that occurred for v1.14.0: the failing test causes ginkgo to exit non-zero which causes the script to abort without running the `saveResult` routine.\r\n\r\nA recent PR to this script fixed a race but we didn't realize that now that the command was running in the foreground (and not the background) that the non-zero status would impact that script.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Sonobuoy can get around this by just using the Golang based runner via `--plugin-env=e2e.E2E_USE_GO_RUNNER=true`. The Go-runner does not seem to have a similar vulnerability. This is going to be the default for Sonobuoy runs starting in Sonobuoy v0.16.0 if the PR gets merged.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think that we may want to consider just removing the bash script all-together for v1.17.0 if the go runner works well for this entire cycle.\r\n\r\nSee the original reporting of the issue and diagnosis here: https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/issues/910\r\n\r\n/sig testing\r\n/area conformance\r\n/priority important-soon",
