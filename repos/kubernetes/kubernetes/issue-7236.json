  "body": "We need to be able to diagnose e2e test failures after the relevant test cluster has been shut down.\n\nRight now this almost works, but not quite.\n\nFluentd can currently only be configured to send log files to one place, for example:\n1. Google Cloud Logging, or\n2. ElasticSearch (running as a pod in the e2e test cluster, and saved to local disk on the node).\n\nWith the current configuration in hack/e2e.go, logs typically go to ElasticSearch (and there is an e2e test to check that that works correctly), and tears down the e2e test cluster after each test run, so the logs are deleted.\n\nThe proposed solution is to have fluentd configurable to send to multiple log collector backends, and configure it as such to both Google Cloud Logging and ElasticSearch for CI e2e test runs to facilitate easier debugging.  Satnam6502@ has offered to sort this out.\n",
