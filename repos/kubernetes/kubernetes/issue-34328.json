For this\n1. I was trying to build the master branch but it failed for s390x due to there was an issue in the file \"server_statvfs_linux.go\". The thing is this issue is resolved in the sftp package but the package is not updated in the Kubernetes repository.  Can you give me an idea when this package will be updated in the Kubernetes code(vendor/github.com/pkg/sftp) ?\n2. Also for the same task when I ran build/release.sh command, I came across docker image gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross which is using golang:1.6.3(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/build/build-image/cross/Dockerfile) as base image and it does not support \n   s390x architecture. Go 1.7.1 is released and it has support for s390x architecture. Is there any plan to update the mentioned docker file for golang 1.7.1 so it will support multiple architectures supported by Go?? And if there is no plan can I add my Docker file specific to s390x so that gcr.io/google_containers/kube-cross docker image will have support for s390x.\n\n@cwsolee  @aborkar-ibm\n",
