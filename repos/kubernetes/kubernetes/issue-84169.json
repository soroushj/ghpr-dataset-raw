Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nA reporter testing their CSI driver at scale noticed issues:\r\n\r\nSpecifically they reported that the pod startup time is impacted by the number of concurrent CSI volume attachments in progress across a cluster.\r\n\r\nAccording to the reporter, the pod start up time jumps from order of seconds (when there are a few volume attachments happening concurrently), to 1-2 minutes once there are >1300 concurrent volume attachments for pods using those attachments.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the reporter indicates that volume detach operations jump from order of seconds (when there are a few volume attach/detach operations happening concurrently), to 3-4 minutes once there are >1300 concurrent volume attachments.\r\n\r\nThe reporter mentioned that the slowness, once it is encountered, does not go away until the number of concurrent volume attaches is reduced below <500.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nIdeally, as the number of CSI volume attachments started in parallel increases the time it takes to start pods remains constant. We should identify the bottle necks and remove as many as possible.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n/sig storage\r\n/sig scalability\r\n/priority important-soon\r\nCC @msau42\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug):\r\n- Others:\r\n",
