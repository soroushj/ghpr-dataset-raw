  "body": "<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->\r\n\r\n**What would you like to be added**: I would like to make kubelet wait for CNI resources to be completely cleaned before deleting the pod from the apiserver. Currently it just waits for containers to be deleted and volumes to be unmounted.\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\nThere are couple of reason why this would make sense:\r\n1) This will make sure that apiserver would provide the true view of the system. Because when pod is not cleaned from CNI because of any issue, then it's better for apiserver to show that the pod is still not terminated properly instead of cleaning up from etcd and relying on the GC to take care of it.\r\n2) Currently the CNI's rely on the apiserver for additional metadata during creation and cleaning up since the kubelet doesn't pass additional metadata to the CNI which was discussed [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/69882) and with apiserver deleting the pod before CNI is successful means CNI has to store kubernetes metadata separately.
