It would be nice to consolidate all the different methods into one common pod creation util, like `e2epod.MakeSecPod`, so that all the tests will automatically support setting fsgroup, selinux, node affinity, etc.\r\n\r\nI think this can be tackled in a few distinct tasks:\r\n- [ ] Improve the interface for `MakeSecPod`. It is really unwieldy to read right now with 10+ arguments. It should probably be a refactored into an argument struct. I think we can rename it as well; I'm not sure what the \"Sec\" really means.\r\n- [ ] Move `SetNodeSelection` into `MakeSecPod` so that every test doesn't have to set it.\r\n- [ ] Migrate individual test suites one by one to use `MakeSecPod`\r\n\r\n/help\r\n@kubernetes/sig-storage-misc \r\n",
