  "body": "A static pods is created directly on a node and then a mirror pod object is created for it on the API server. When a static pods is created on a node, there is no mirror pod yet on the API server.\r\nPriority of pods are resolved from `PodSpec.PriorityClassName` to the integer value of priority by an API server admission plugin. So, when a static pods is created and goes through Kubelet admission, it does not have an integer priority. If the static pods is critical, the kubelet will not realize it, since the priority value determines whether the pod is critical or not. This caused #80203 when we removed the deprecated critical pod annotation.\r\nIn order to solve this issue, SIG Node decided to consider all static pods as critical regardless of their `PodSpec.PriorityClassName`.\r\n\r\nSIG node recommends using regular pods over static pods and limiting the usage of static pods to cases, such as cluster bootstrapping, that other solutions are not feasible.\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n/sig node\r\n\r\ncc/ @dchen1107 ",
