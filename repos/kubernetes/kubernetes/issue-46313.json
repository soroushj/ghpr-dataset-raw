  "body": "Lately we introduced a bug that editing ExternalTrafficPolicy doesn't trigger LoadBalancer update. All our ESIPP e2e tests didn't catch it. Specifically, in test _\"should handle updates to ExternalTrafficPolicy field\"_ we flip ExternalTrafficPolicy between Local and Global and verify kube-proxy takes action, but the servicecontroller part is omitted.\r\n\r\nThis bug is being fixed by #46258. I don't have enough bandwidth to update the e2e test for now. Filing this issue for tracking.\r\n\r\n/sig network\r\n/assign",
