An alternative might be to do something like https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter with nsenter via a container, but jpetazzo's container is also not actively curated and is using an old version of util-linux too.  It's probably not appropriate to simply calculate the latest util-linux and download it, versus a specific one by version.  But that means a steady stream of tweaks to update the version in use as new util-linux come out and are demonstrated to still be compatible.  Would be a nice place to add CI as Trusty's LTS with a couple more years of support so this issue is unfortunately likely to hang around.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu Trusty Tahr\r\n",
