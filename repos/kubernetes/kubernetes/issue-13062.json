  "body": "Some e2e tests are slow by necessity and design.  Others are slow through non-optimal implementation.  We don't want these to slow down the completion of the faster e2e tests.  \n\nThe former group (slow by necessity) need to go into their own group in perpetuity.  The latter need to go into quarantine until they can be speeded up.  As a first step the two groups can share one test job.\n\nThis is not just a theoretical problem.  Right now, e2e tests are often timing out after 2 hours.  Not long ago they completed in 30 minutes.\n",
