It is a known issue since docker 1.3.0, might even earlier version (docker/docker#9139). Docker 1.7.0-rcX (the one I am currently validating) should have a fix for it. Once you restart docker, the problem should be gone, and the node should be recovered. I saw a similar problem before. On each node, there is a monit healthchecking docker daemon process periodically, in most cases, the docker in such bad state will be restarted by monit.\n\nBefore we have such fix from docker 1.7, we can set docker's hard memory limit to 70% of node capacity since we already put docker into a cgroup with unlimited limit today. This could be a temporary workaround recovering node from bad state. \n\nRelated docker issue: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9139\n\ncc/ @lavalamp @bprashanth \n",
