  "body": "If a node is attached to a cloud provider and the machine is in any state other than running/available/ready/whatever cloud provider uses to indicate ready, it will be removed from the kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\nLooking at the various cloud providers, some of them filter nodes based on the state whereas others do not.  The node controller has logic for handling a node that is not updating status and evicting pods/tainting the node as needed.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why the cloud providers only return instances/vms that are \"ready\" instead of returning any instance/vm that matches the requested name?  It seems like it might be more consistent to have the cloud providers only filter on name and allow the caller to determine what to do if the found instance isn't in a desired state.\r\n\r\n@gmarek @justinsb ",
