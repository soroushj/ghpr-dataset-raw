  "body": "Currently a job's `.spec.parallelism` defaults to 2.  @bgrant0607 suggested defaulting `.spec.parallelism` to `.spec.completions`.  This will allow users to leave it unspecified in most cases, and it will do something intuitive. (Maybe this was how it was in @soltysh original PR, can't recall if it was that or 1).\n\nThe current default of 2 I liked because it encourages users to think about making their containers concurrency-safe.  But so does setting it from `.spec.completions`.  And people will ask why it was \n\nI don't like defaulting to 1 as much because I think people will usually want to override it when they have multiple completions.\n",
