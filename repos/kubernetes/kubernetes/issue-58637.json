  "body": "People want the ability to specify specific pods within a (different) namespace in NetworkPolicies.\r\n\r\nI propose we change the documentation/definition of `NetworkPolicyPeer` so that instead of saying \"Exactly one of its fields must be specified\", we say that there are 4 valid kinds of NetworkPolicyPeer:\r\n\r\n1. If only `PodSelector` is set, then the peer selects the indicated pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.\r\n2. If only `NamespaceSelector` is set, then the peer selects all pods in the indicated namespaces.\r\n3. (**NEW**) If both `PodSelector` and `NamespaceSelector` are set, then the peer selects the indicated pods in the indicated namespaces. (And, in particular, if `PodSelector` is set and `NamespaceSelector` is `{}`, then the peer selects the indicated pods in all namespaces.)\r\n4. If only `IPBlock` is set, then the peer selects the indicated IP addresses.\r\n\r\nAs before, it would be invalid to have a `NetworkPolicyPeer` in which all fields were unset, or in which both `IPBlock` and any other field were set.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't create any compatibility issues: no old policies would be interpreted differently under the new rules, because the new rules only describe the interpretation of policies that would be invalid under the old rules. And likewise, policies using the new features would not be interpreted incorrectly by old plugins; they'd just be rejected as invalid.\r\n\r\n/sig network\r\n/kind feature\r\n",
