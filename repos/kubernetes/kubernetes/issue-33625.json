  "body": "Alpha to beta (1.5): \n- Declare 2 sets of annotations, one in the alpha namespace (already exists) and one in the beta namespace (new)\n- alpha always takes precedence\n- If alpha is set to a valid value, we write the beta annotation to mirror it clobbering any user field\n\nWhy convert alpha to beta:     \n1. Users are auto transitioned \n2. Not converting means if alpha and beta are set to 2 different values, deleting the alpha requires a cleanup of the alpha value, and an activation of the beta value. This might be confusing and error prone. \n3. Not converting makes handling updates harder, as we would have to allow updates to the \"inactive\" one.\n\nBeta to GA (1.6): \n- Declare 2 fields that mirros the annotations in beta\n- Ignore alpha annotations (any alpha annotations in play will continue to work because they were translated to the beta annotation)\n- Perform the same conversion time clobbering\n\nIf users upgrade from 1.4 to 1.6 directly, the alpha annotation is ignored and esipp stops working. \n",
