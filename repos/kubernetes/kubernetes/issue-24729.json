  "body": "We currently invoke flush on the HTTP response after every watch event, in order to guarantee clients see watches immediately.  That flush impacts throughput at scale, and may result in undesirable context switches in the server process.  We should investigate deferred flushes, allowing the client to set an upper latency bound, or automatically adjusting the flush rate due to throughput.\n\nIn a 8 core benchmark of watch decode performance, it's roughly 25% faster not to flush than to flush (30us per iteration vs 40us per iteration) - and time spent over 1m in that loop goes from 67% waiting on syscall to 17% waiting on sys call, with much more time spent in GC.\n\n@wojtek-t @kubernetes/sig-scalability\n",
