  "body": "Calling the .Round() operation to maintain compat with millisecond values is ~90% of the optimized node conversion/decode path in terms of allocations, and the more resources we have, the more expensive it gets.  In addition, quantities are rarely compared, but we do the decode of the value eagerly, which is expensive.  Quantity needs to get much more efficient.\n\nSome areas to investigate:\n1. Can we reduce the number of allocations in normal use of Quantity and inf.Dec without more drastic changes?\n2. Can we make .String() on a Quantity much more efficient, and then potentially defer decoding it unless we need to change it?  Right now it's a large part of Node and Pod output, and is likely going to impact the scheduler more than other components.  (a naive implementation of this was tried, but String() is far too expensive to be a speed up).\n3. Can we do a \"fast path\" for Quantities that have less precision than int64 (99.99% of them) that is efficient?\n4. We should create benchmarks for the following quantity operations - serialization to JSON, string(), copy, round, and validation\n\nQuantity is now the primary source of allocations during encode/decode/conversion after protobuf and the other conversion improvements are taken into account.  If we can tackle this for 1.3 we can potentially get another 10-25% improvement in master CPU for anything with quantity (pods, nodes, quota, limit ranges, scheduling).\n",
