  "body": "All controllers in apps/v1 now have immutable selectors. While working on [converting Deployment to use apps/v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61419), I discovered that Deployment is incompatible with apps/v1 ReplicaSet because it expects to be able to add `pod-template-hash` to the ReplicaSet's selector if it's missing.\r\n\r\nAccording to @janetkuo, this was a convenience feature to allow Deployments to adopt user-created ReplicaSets that weren't created directly by any Deployment. Given that this feature is incompatible with immutable ReplicaSet selectors, it seems that we need to consider either dropping/weakening the feature, or relaxing ReplicaSet selector immutability.\r\n\r\nSince we already launched `apps/v1` Deployment with this feature, it would be a breaking change to weaken it or stop supporting it. That means Deployment would need to keep using ReplicaSet via `extensions/v1beta1` (which allows selector mutation) until `apps/v2` exists (with this feature deprecated and disabled by default) *and* `apps/v1` is removed (so the controller no longer needs to implement the feature at all). That would put us in the awkward position of supporting `extensions/v1beta1` for longer than `apps/v1`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to go ahead with a breaking change in `apps/v1` (dropping/weakening the feature in question). The impact would depend on whether people actually rely on this behavior, and on whether any existing documentation explicitly recommends doing this. Note that this would only help if we *also* break the feature in `extensions/v1beta1` Deployment; if the controller still needs to implement the feature, it's stuck using ReplicaSet via `extensions/v1beta1`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, relaxing ReplicaSet selector immutability (possibly only to allow certain types of mutations) in `apps/v1` would be a backwards-compatible change. The original selector immutability proposal called out this possibility as justification for starting out fully immutable -- you can relax, but you can't tighten. This would mean in 1.11 we relax ReplicaSet selector immutability, and then in 1.12 we can finally move Deployment to use ReplicaSet via `apps/v1` (since the controller needs to work against +/-1 minor version skewed apiservers during HA upgrades).\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue to start a discussion about which path we should take, or other suggestions for how to resolve this.\r\n\r\n/sig apps\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\ncc @kow3ns @kubernetes/sig-apps-bugs @kubernetes/sig-apps-api-reviews \r\n\r\nThis is a blocker for #55714.",
