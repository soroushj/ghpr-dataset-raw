  "body": "Recent [run](https://k8s-gubernator.appspot.com/build/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-e2e-gce-scale-performance/193) failed to up the cluster as the last MIG was waiting for all VMs to come up, but it took super long and eventually timed out after ~22 hours. I remember this happening few times in the past as well.\r\n\r\nI think we should timeout while [waiting until stable](https://github.com/shyamjvs/kubernetes/blob/bb8f58b6e655cf55e029ee21d44934c1ef8878d9/cluster/gce/util.sh#L2327) operation to avoid arbitrary waiting time and then proceed with whatever number of VMs were already created. My feeling is this change should be made not just in testing, but also for production - to not make cluster startup time unbounded.\r\n\r\n@wojtek-t @mborsz - Thoughts?",
