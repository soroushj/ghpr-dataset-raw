  "body": "If I have a volume with 3 targets, iSCSI volume plugin tries to log in into each target. If it succeeds with at least one target, it mounts the volume.\r\n\r\nI experience login timeouts quite frequently when I drain a node with >20 iSCSI volumes with 3 paths each - these volumes need to be re-attached to different nodes and `iscsiadm --login` sometimes times out  under such load. In the worst case, two targets for the same device time out and I end up with only one path that's not even part of multipath.\r\n\r\nIMO, the volume plugin should try several to log in to all targets. Or at least wait until it has two paths. It should never mount a single path if multipath was requested.\r\n\r\n/sig storage\r\n@j-griffith @bswartz @rootfs @humblec ",
