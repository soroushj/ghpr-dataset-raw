  "body": "**FEATURE REQUEST** \r\nThe current behavior of StatefulSet is to not create a successor Pod before all predecessors are Running and Ready. The current implementation will not deadlock if more than one Pod is failed, but it will fail to make progress if a Pod is unhealthy. Specifically, if Pod-0 and Pod-4 are both dead, the current implementation will attempt to resurrect Pod-0, but it will not attempt to resurrect Pod-4 until Pod-0 is Running and Ready. This behavior is generally safe, and it is required for some categories of StatefulSets.\r\n\r\nHowever, for other categories of StatefulSets that are able to form a cluster without respect to the ordering and state of deployed Pods, this behavior is constraining #39363 and can lead to the application becoming unavailable unnecessarily #41012.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to be able to specify an annotation that communicates to the StatefulSet controller that it can launch more than one Pod simultaneously. \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nstatefulset.alpha.kubernetes.io/burst=<replicas>\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhere \"replicas\" represents the maximum number of sequential replicas that the controller will allow to be unavailable at a given time. Constraining the number is useful for applications that need to form a quorum prior to launching further members.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the semantics below\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nstatefulset.alpha.kubernetes.io/burst=all\r\n``` \r\n\r\nwhere \"all\" indicates that the controller should burst up to StatefulSet.Spec.Replicas would be useful for applications that have a uniqueness, but no ordering constraint.\r\n",
