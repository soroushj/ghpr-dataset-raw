  "body": "- Scanning device after the hot attach of disk fails \n- Couldn't match device ID with UUID returned from AttachDisk()\n- Unmount fails because of \\040 for space encoding in mount path after datastore name\n- DetachDisk() has to take volumePath(unique identifier) instead of diskID\n- Scoping of err variable in AddDevice() call causes attachDisk() to fail later at mount instead of immediate failure\n-  Volume attach disk with a non-existent caught as a failure at mount rather than attach\n\nFixed in #26658 \n",
