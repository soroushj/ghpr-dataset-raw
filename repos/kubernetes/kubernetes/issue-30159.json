  "body": "While attempting to do some work on #28695, @MHBauer and I discovered a separate issue that was causing the date command to fail while running `kubectl run test --rm --restart=Never -it --image=ubuntu -- date`:\n\n> For this case, the `date` command executes and finishes during one of the pod waiting loops in `pkg/kubectl/cmd/run.go#waitForPodRunning()`.\n> `waitForPodRunning` returns `status.Succeeded` to `handleAttachPod()` which decides to do a `Logs` operation on the pod, as there is no place to attach.\n> \n> Somehow (we're not sure of the details, and are not sure how apiserver communicates to kubelet) we end up in `pkg/kublet/dockertools/kube_docker_client.go#Logs()` where the call to docker using the client with `ContainerLogs()` is made. After, we call `redirectResponseToOutptStream()`. Inside of that, it says that it is not a tty, so we execute the docker code `StdCopy()`, which demultiplexes stdout and stderr from the dock response to the request for logs. Unfortunately, when we created the container, we told docker it was a rawTTY, so docker is returning non-multiplexed output.\n> \n> The tty setting needs to be pulled from the container config. In `pkg/kubelet/dockertools/docker_manager.go#GetContainerLogs()` it is always set to false.\n> \n> ```\n> sopts := StreamOptions{\n>     OutputStream: stdout,\n>     ErrorStream:  stderr,\n>     RawTerminal:  false,\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> `RawTerminal` needs to be set based on the container config, and not set unconditionally.\n> \n> We could use a clue as to how to go about achieving this. I am on the slack if anyone wants to have a chat about this.\n",
