  "body": "In contrib/mesos/pkg/executor/executor.go, there is a local constant named containerPollTime that is put to two very different uses --- waiting for a pod to come up, and recovering from pods getting \"lost\".  The former needs to be very responsive, but the latter does not (but is still costly when the number of pods grows).  The value is currently set to one second, and that makes both things happen frequently.  It would be better if there were two different constants, so the monitoring for lost pods can be less frequent.\n",
