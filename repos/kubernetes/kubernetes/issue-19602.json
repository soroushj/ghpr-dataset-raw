  "body": "There is a race between detaching a volume when an old pod is being destroyed and attaching the same volume to a new pod on the same node:\n1. pod A happily uses a volume\n2. pod A is deleted (and kubelet starts to clean up the stuff)\n3. pod B starts, with the same volume (and kubelet starts to set it up...)\n\nAt this point, the volume is still attached to the node, kubelet is really slow when destroying it...\n1. kubelet attaches the volume to the node, because pod B will need it. This does not do anything, because the volume is already attached there.\n2. kubelet mounts the volume to pod B directory (which is OK)\n3. kubelet unmounts the volume from pod A directory (again, OK)\n4. kubelet detaches the volume from the node, because pod A is being destroyed. _This detaches the volume, while it's still mounted into pod B directory_\n5. kubelet starts pod B containers -> problems.\n\nThere should be some usage counter, so kubelet just decreases \"reference count'\" at step 7 instead of detaching the volume. Similar approach is already present in AWS code.\n\n@kubernetes/rh-storage \n",
