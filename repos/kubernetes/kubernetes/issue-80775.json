  "body": "**What would you like to be added:**\r\n`Filter` plugins of the scheduling framework need to indicate whether a pod that is unschedulable on a node could potentially be schedulable if one or more other existing pods are removed from the node. In other words, whether preemption can help make the pod schedulable. For example, a taint filter may return an \"unresolvable\" infeasibility for a node, because removal of other pods is not going to change taints, while a resource check filter return a \"resovable\" infeasibility.\r\n\r\nOne idea to address this problem is to add another [`Status.Code`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/75d51896125b1cafd9e995212b02ccda9b8a0aed/pkg/scheduler/framework/v1alpha1/interface.go#L48) for unresolvable infeasibility. We currently have `Unschedulable`. We can add something like `UnschedulableAndUnresolvable` (or a better name). If a filter plugin returns this code for a node, the scheduler will not attempt preemption for that node.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is to put the information in the scheduler plugin config. For each filter plugin, the config indicates whether it is resolvable or not. This will act similar to what we [currently have in the scheduler code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/75d51896125b1cafd9e995212b02ccda9b8a0aed/pkg/scheduler/core/generic_scheduler.go#L65) (it is hard coded). This approach works well too, but it is static. The previous approach allows filter plugins to return different codes dynamically and depending on the conditions of the cluster. For example, a plugin that checks availability of resources may return `UnschedulableAndUnresolvable` when it sees that the incoming pod has lower priority than all other existing pods on the node.\r\n\r\nPlease share your opinion about the two approaches or other proposals so that we can choose one to implement.\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n/priority important-soon\r\nref/ kubernetes/enhancements#624",
