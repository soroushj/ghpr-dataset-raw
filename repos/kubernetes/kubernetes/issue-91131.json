  "body": "**What happened**:\r\n\r\nWe enabled [GOAWAY](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88567) feature in our large-scale cluster, and we found client(Kubelet) may got error(500 http code response) like `request declared a Content-Length of N but only wrote 0 bytes` after received GOAWAY frame. \r\n\r\nI had already re-produce this bug and open an [issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39086) in golang repo. So far I think this bug only occur with a small probability when client request server in high concurrency use a same httpclient instance, and it's a golang sdk bug in http client.\r\n\r\n**Before I solved this issue, I suggest do NOT enable GOAWAY(`--goaway-chance=0`) feature. As it's a golang sdk bug(currently I known and doubt) in http client, revert GOAWAY feature(codes) is not necessary.**\r\n\r\n",
