  "body": "I was working on separate demo based on guestbook-go example and wanted to push some updates to it's code. \r\nBut looks like there are multiple versions. About 6 months ago some examples were moved to https://github.com/kubernetes/examples and have their README mention it. \r\nIt was not noticed couple of times and resulted in new examples still being added to old location.\r\nI think remaining examples should be moved and whole directory removed to avoid confusion. \r\n\r\nTo allow anyone to pick that issue would be nice to for someone to describe what else should be done beside removing directory so nothing breaks (docs, etc.)\r\n\r\n/area example\r\n/kind cleanup\r\n/sig apps\r\ncc @ahmetb\r\n",
