  "body": "Currently we assume that the cluster is healthy if 99% of Nodes are. We keep on waiting for more nodes even after 99% are up, until all Nodes are ready or we reach the timeout, even though we know that the cluster will be considered healthy.\n\nThe question is shouldn't we finish validation when 99% of the cluster is up. This will increase the possibility that some additional Nodes will join the cluster after it started, but I'm not sure that's bad.\n\nMy proposal is to do it, i.e. validate cluster should wait only for first 99% of the cluster.\n\n@smarterclayton @lavalamp @wojtek-t @zmerlynn @davidopp \n",
