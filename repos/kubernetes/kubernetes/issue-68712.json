Linking out to the docs is ok, but I shouldn't have to click through the links to understand how to use the Job object.  The Job description and the job status fields should *clearly* indicate what fields are set in completion states on the job, because that's 100% of the point of docs.  Taking a summary of the jobs-run-to-completion link and putting it in job.status.conditions, job.status, and job would improve the actual utility of our API doc.\r\n\r\nWe should also do a pass on other objects and make the actual in server docs more useful.\r\n\r\n@kubernetes/sig-apps-bugs ",
