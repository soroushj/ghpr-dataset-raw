  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n\r\n/kind feature\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nAfter setting up an IntelliJ project files for the Kubernetes repo, I had IntelliJ related project files in the directory. Wanting to clean up some generated `bazel-*` files, I ran `make clean`. I was surprised to see that my IntelliJ project files were deleted as well.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nI would have expected `make clean` to remove only files generated by kubernetes development commands. I would not have expected it to not delete files that I created and intended to be long-lasting, but were only usable by me, and thus gitignored.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nCreate a IntelliJ project for Kubernetes that places `.idea/` or `.iml` files in the repo. Run `make clean`. The IntelliJ project will be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely ensure what the correct behavior is here. I see the change to use `git clean -Xdf` was made recently by @cblecker in this [pr](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51911). The reasons stated in the pr make a lot of sense to me. However, I think this doesn't cover the edge case in which a file is gitignored because it should be long-lasting and it will be unique to each development environment, and thus should not be removed on every `make clean`.\r\n\r\nI'd love to work on figuring out the proper behavior here, and submitting a pr to fix - please let me know how I can help :)\r\n",
