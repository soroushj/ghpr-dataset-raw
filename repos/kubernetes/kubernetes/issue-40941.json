Specifically, depending on the operating system, the pod will hang in the ContainerCreating stage with either a \"Could not attach disk: Timeout after 10s\" error (CentOS 7) or an error about establishing a session when one already exists (Ubuntu 14).\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nThe pod should successfully mount the LUN.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\nGiven a working iSCSI target and a single node Kubernetes cluster:\r\n\r\n1. Create a LUN on the iSCSI target\r\n2. Create a pod that uses the LUN from step 1 (either natively or through a PV/PVC)\r\n3. Create a new LUN on the iSCSI target (note that the target portal and IQN must be identical).\r\n4. Create a pod that uses the LUN from step 3.\r\n\r\nThe pod created in step 4 will fail to start.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know**:\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this is due to a bug with the Kubernetes iSCSI implementation.  The AttachDisk() function in pkg/volume/iscsi/iscsi_util.go first checks if the LUN exists in /dev/disk/by-path/; if it doesn't, it attempts to log in to the target and recheck for the LUN's existence (lines 123-138 in the 1.5 branch).  In this case, though, the session already exists, as it was created with the pod in step 2.  In Ubuntu, attempting to log in a second time triggers an error, which gets reported in the pod description.  In CentOS 7, this gets treated as a NOP; however, the new LUN will never become visible, and thus, the pod will fail to start.\r\n\r\nThis can be solved manually by logging into the host and running `iscsiadm -m session --rescan`.  It should be possible to fix it in Kubernetes by adding a check in AttachDisk() to see if a session already exists for the target portal and IQN and, if so, doing a rescan of the session.",
