  "body": "**What would you like to be added**:\r\nI would like the number of test images to be reduced and the documentation improved. The list is in this file:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/utils/image/manifest.go\r\n\r\nLooking at this list, it is not clear why we have so many images or why/how that image is being used.\r\n\r\nIn many cases tests just want to confirm image=`X` and/or after an update the image changes to `Y` and other types of non-functional tests.\r\n\r\nThe ways to reduce the image count include:\r\n - In all the places that the image doesn't matter, ensure we are using the same dummy images.\r\n - In cases where there is very little needed functionality we may be able to just make a generic test image which provides all the needed functionality. In this way we could potentially aggregate 10 images worth of functionality into 1 image.\r\n\r\nWe still need the images to support multi-arch and use manifests.\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\n - It makes it easier to understand what test images we have and why we have them (for any dev that looks at it)\r\n - It makes it easier to understand which image you should choose if you are writing a new test and need some guidance\r\n - It reduces the number/size of the images needed in order to test the cluster which is important for testing air-gapped clusters.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 47 images, which end up at 7.4 GB",
