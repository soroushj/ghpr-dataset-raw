  "body": "The `kubelet` has a constant `maxWaitForContainerRuntime` that is set at 5 minutes.\nsee: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L105\n\nIf `docker` daemon goes down, and it is unable to restart for any reason (storage is corrupt, etc.), the `kubelet` will wait for 5 minutes before reporting the node as `NotReady`.  This is because that wait period is plumbed through the code that monitors the container runtime state to know how to report if a node Ready condition.\nsee: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/runtime.go#L91\n\nThis has real-world impacts in following scenarios:\n1. user has a pod on node X with `RestartPolicy=Always`, container run-time goes down, pod reports with `Status=Completed` in CLI because it has an exit code, where `Initialized=True,Ready=False,PodScheduled=True`, but its never actually able to restart.  The user has to wait 5 minutes for the node to report `NotReady`, and then another 5 minutes for node controller to evict the pod before ultimately getting a new backing pod created.  \n2. new pods continue to get scheduled to this node, but are never able to run in a sufficient amount of time.\n\nEither case results in 10 minutes of unexpected downtime, where 5 minutes of that time is not tunable by operators.\n\nTo address this issue, I could see us doing any of the following:\n1. `kubelet` can tune `maxWaitForContainerRuntime` via a new flag.\n2. `kubelet` can provide a separate SLA on how many attempts it makes to start or restart a scheduled pod if container runtime is reporting an error before actively evicting the pod.\n\nThoughts?\n\n@kubernetes/sig-node @yujuhong @kubernetes/rh-cluster-infra @smarterclayton \n",
