Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nWorking on a generalization of the max-in-flight filter, I noticed it is positioned inconsistently in the secure vs insecure handler chains.\r\nAt https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a1f1f0b599e961a5c59b02c349c0ed818b1851a5/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/config.go#L589 I see it is very late in the secure handler chain, just before authorization.\r\nAt https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a1f1f0b599e961a5c59b02c349c0ed818b1851a5/pkg/kubeapiserver/server/insecure_handler.go#L34 I see it comes much earlier, preceding audit, authentication, and timeout (unlike the secured chain).\r\n\r\nNB: by \"early\" and \"late\" here I refer to the order in which the filters run, which is the opposite of the order in which they are constructed.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI expected the two handler chains to put the filters they have in common in the same order.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug):\r\n- Others:\r\n",
