In theory we shouldn't be allowed to delete the top level resources while something has a pointer to them, but the GCE api might change. The test needs to also dig into the other L7 resources and make sure the delete wasn't shallow (i.e health checks, instance groups, target proxies, url maps). \n\nref https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/16048\n",
