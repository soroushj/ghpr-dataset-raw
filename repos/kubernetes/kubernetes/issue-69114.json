  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\n- Current call sequence of [```unmapDeviceFunc```](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/util/operationexecutor/operation_generator.go#L1069) generated by ```GenerateUnmapDeviceFunc``` is as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) Check that symlink doesn't exist in globalMapPath to ensure that no one is accessing a device to detach \r\n  (2) Call ```TearDownDevice``` for driver to detach the device from the node\r\n  (3) Delete globalMapPath\r\n  (4) Delete descriptor lock by removing loop device\r\n\r\nFor backend storage that can't detach a device while descriptor lock is held, the order of calling (2) and (4) makes problem.\r\nAs a workaround, [rbd driver release the descriptor lock inside (2) before detaching a device](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/rbd/rbd.go#L962).\r\nThis makes difficult to implement ```TearDownDevice``` properly for csi driver that can work with all backend storage, because it needs to handle both backend which requires descriptor lock to be released before detaching a device and backend which doesn't requires it.\r\n\r\n- This issue should be resolved by changing the sequense as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) Check that symlink doesn't exist in globalMapPath to ensure that no one is accessing a device to detach \r\n  (2) Delete descriptor lock by removing loop device\r\n  (3) Call ```TearDownDevice``` for driver to detach the device from the node\r\n  (4) Delete globalMapPath\r\n\r\nNote that the issue of failure in releasing descriptor lock in ```unmapDeviceFunc```, which is described in local attach drivers' ```TearDownDevice``` [comments](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/iscsi/iscsi_util.go#L673), should be resolved now. Because in current implementation of ```mapVolumeFunc```, [taking file descriptor lock](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/util/operationexecutor/operation_generator.go#L912) and [updating ```volumeToMount```](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/util/operationexecutor/operation_generator.go#L919) are done to the same ```devicePath```. Therefore, there should be no need to release descriptor lock inside ```TearDownDevice```.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nRun below e2e tests on environment with ```BlockVolume=true```\r\n  - ```--ginkgo.focus=\"In-tree.*iscsi.*Pre-provision.*block.*volumeMode.*should create.*\"```\r\n  - ```--ginkgo.focus=\"In-tree.*rbd.*Pre-provision.*block.*volumeMode.*should create.*\"```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n/sig storage\r\n\r\nThis issue is opened as a separated issue from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68635 \r\nCSI drivers that requires the descriptor lock to be release before detaching device won't work well on ```TearDownDevice```, until this issue is fixed.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): # ```kubectl version\r\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"13+\", GitVersion:\"v1.13.0-alpha.0.1580+07e81cb8ff590d-dirty\", GitCommit:\"07e81cb8ff590d096a61e951a3e6b4fc9076fb08\", GitTreeState:\"dirty\", BuildDate:\"2018-09-26T19:23:23Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.10.3\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"13+\", GitVersion:\"v1.13.0-alpha.0.1580+07e81cb8ff590d-dirty\", GitCommit:\"07e81cb8ff590d096a61e951a3e6b4fc9076fb08\", GitTreeState:\"dirty\", BuildDate:\"2018-09-26T19:23:23Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.10.3\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}```\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: kvm\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): ```Fedora release 27 (Twenty Seven)```\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): ```Linux csi-k8s 4.13.9-300.fc27.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Oct 23 13:41:58 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux```\r\n- Install tools: ```local-up-cluster.sh```\r\n- Others:\r\n",
