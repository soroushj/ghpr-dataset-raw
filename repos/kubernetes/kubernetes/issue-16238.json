  "body": "The aws-sdk-go library just renamed a package from internal -> private to work around Go's vendoring experiment changes:\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/commit/c09f1bb2f2270137bd1708d4668dc6beb2fb52f2\n\nBut we have a Godep dependency on some of these internal packages (we don't use them directly, but Godeps saves them anyway)\n\nThe problem is that godep ignores the branch when first pulling the code because it shells out to `go get`, so it tries to do a fetch on a package that doesn't exist on master: https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/186\n\nI think this combines to mean that `godep restore` is broken right now (or at least returning an exit code; I'm not sure if it actually is OK).  If you have a dirty Godeps tree, `hack/verify-godeps.sh` will also fail (but there is a short-circuit in there when the tree is clean which means that Shippable is still passing).\n\nI don't know really how we should fix this (properly).  A workaround is to manually:\n\n```\nrm -rf ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go\npushd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/\ngit checkout v0.9.9\npopd\ngodep restore\n```\n",
