I had spun up the cluster from a directory inside the downloaded release, but tried to tear it down from the root directory of my local git repo. I was surprised to see that you can't tear down a cluster without the server binaries, salt config, and manifests (output below). I'm not sure why any of these should be needed to tear down a cluster. It wasn't a big deal since I still had the downloaded release around, but if I had deleted it I'd be pretty annoyed at having to re-download it or build it locally just to delete my cluster. \r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ ./cluster/kube-down.sh\r\nBringing down cluster using provider: gce\r\n!!! Cannot find kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz\r\n!!! Cannot find kubernetes-salt.tar.gz\r\n!!! Cannot find kubernetes-manifests.tar.gz\r\nRequired binaries appear to be missing. Do you wish to download them? [Y/n]\r\n```",
