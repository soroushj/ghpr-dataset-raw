  "body": "With 1.1, we allow pods to be created with hostNetwork = true.\nThese pods should be allowed to use Cluster DNS, if the pod spec says so.\n\nWe have already wired the kube-proxy to support traffic from the host machine to be directed to kube-services. We should similarly allow cluster dns names to be looked up by pods with hostNetwork=true.\n\nThis way, pods can use hostNetwork = true and still leverage kubernetes' service discovery mechanisms.\n\nI currently have a use case, where I am writing a GCE Firewall pod, that configures iptables on the nodes. This pod needs to run with hostNetwork=true to configure iptables and the same time needs to look up a kubernetes pod service to read some metadata.\nRefer to #17405\nhttps://github.com/ArtfulCoder/kubernetes/blob/prototype2/contrib/gce-firewall/client.yaml#L19\n\nCurrently, I have hard-coded a Kubernetes service-ip since we dont have cluster dns for hostNetworked-pods.  This is hardly a workable solution.\n\nI would imagine that third-party network plugins would also face similar issues if they try to do a clean implementation.\n\nOption 2:\nThe other option is to query API server to do service discovery. But this doesn't seem like a clean solution, especially since we have put in so much effort into our DNS based service discovery approach.\n",
