Distributed claims come in very handy when the claim content is fairly large, as is the case e.g. for `groups` claims in some existing IDP implementations.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nI have a [proof of concept commit][1] that adds distributed claims resolution.  It doesn't support multiple issues which is probably something that needs to be addressed, but I'm willing to take that work on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/filmil/kubernetes/commit/6a8d5b67e812a44288598fbb581d57820a1e1d85\r\n[2]: https://github.com/kubernetes/apiserver/blob/master/plugin/pkg/authenticator/token/oidc/oidc.go",
