  "body": "Forked from #3135. \n\nFor testing master upgrades, we will need a test harness that:\n1. Launches a cluster at some known version (e.g. latest release)\n2. Runs some amount of work on the cluster\n   - Running e2es would be ok, but e2e tests tend to try and clean up after themselves and therefore a test that is better suited would be one that keeps running during the upgrade\n3. Upgrade the master to a new version (e.g. latest release running in jenkins)\n   - For GCE, we should use [cluster/gce/upgrade.sh](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/gce/upgrade.sh) for this part (and fix it as necessary)\n4. Verifies that the cluster is still in a sane state (from the previous tests)\n5. Runs e2e tests against the upgraded cluster. \n\n/cc @zmerlynn @satnam6502 \n",
