  "body": "@resouer I just noticed you forgot to register the image locality priority function in `init()` in `plugin/pkg/scheduler/algorithmprovider/defaults/defaults.go`\n\nI also missed it when I reviewed your PR.\n\nI have fixed this in #21235. But it would be great if you could figure out a mechanism that would ensure that all predicate/priority functions that are tested (you can assume they will always live under `plugin/pkg/scheduler/algorithm/{predicates,priorities}`) are registered, and fail the test if not. That will allow us to prevent this mistake in the future.\n",
