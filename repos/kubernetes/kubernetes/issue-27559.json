  "body": "While checking the iptables (pkg/util/iptables/iptables.go) implementation, its restore logic still use a temporary file to pass the iptable commands. It requires caller has RW permission on tmp folder (which is true in most cases), and it also involves unnecessary file IO operation that impacts the performance. \n\nSuggest improving it by passing commands via memory. \n",
