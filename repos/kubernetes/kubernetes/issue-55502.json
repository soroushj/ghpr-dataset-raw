  "body": "On AWS when we call \"attach\" of a volume then we periodically we check (via `DescribeVolume` API call) if volume has indeed been attached. We run the check in a loop with timeout of 21 minutes.\r\n\r\nAWS documents that - if a volume is stuck in \"attaching\" state for too long, the node where volume is being attached is in \"dirty\" state and must be rebooted to fix the problem. Until node is rebooted, more pods with volumes to same node is only going be stuck in same state (i.e \"attaching\").\r\n\r\nWe propose that - if attach operation times out waiting for volume in \"attaching\" state, we should simply taint the node so as it can not affect other pods and a admin can manually fix the node.\r\n\r\n/sig aws\r\n/sig storage\r\n\r\ncc @derekwaynecarr @justinsb ",
