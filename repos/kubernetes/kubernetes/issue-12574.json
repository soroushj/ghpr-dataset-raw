  "body": "In https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/proposals/resource-qos.md, we have defined the QoS of CPU/Memory resources. Based on the description, I think it would make more sense to use requested resource instead of resource limit when prioritizing the node with respect to free resources. That is, free resource on a node should be measured by `capacity - sum_of_requested_resource`.\n\nBesides, limits are replaced by requests in the corresponding predicate function `CheckPodsExceedingFreeResources()`, so I think it is necessary that we make similar changes in prioritizer function. \n\nWhat do you think? I would be happy to implement this if you think it is OK.\n\n@davidopp @AnanyaKumar \n\n> update 2015.08.14:\n\nIn fact, as mentioned by @AnanyaKumar in the comments, we should use request instead of limit when scheduling. So, basically we need to change almost every limit in all priority functions. I will handle them carefully and send PR sooner. We can have further discussion based on the PR.\n\nRegards\n",
