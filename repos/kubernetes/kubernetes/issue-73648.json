  "body": "Today you can use UID as a precondition for delete; this allows you to avoid deleting an object that has been replaced with an object of the same name.\r\n\r\nAs reported by @fasaxc on slack, there's also a need to ensure a delete fails if an unobserved change happens to an object. This could be implemented as either an RV or a Generation precondition.\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n\r\n1) A observes object foo and sends a delete request.\r\n2) B observes object foo and modifies it in a way that would have prevented its deletion.\r\n3) A's delete request happens to arrive afterwards; the object is deleted and B's change is lost.\r\n\r\n/sig api-machinery",
