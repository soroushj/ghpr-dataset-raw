  "body": "v1.3.0\n\nBackground\nI was trying to use `kube-up.sh` to set up a cluster on Azure, but the script seemed not to take my `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` envvar, so I started poking around `cluster/azure/util.sh`\n\nIn `get-common-params()` on Line 167, the script first declares some array variables, like so\n\n```\ndeclare -a AZKUBE_AUTH_PARAMS\ndeclare -a AZKUBE_DOCKER_PARAMS\ndeclare -a AZKUBE_RESOURCE_GROUP_PARAM\n```\n\nIn the middle, on Line 182 and 186, it attempts to assign to entirely different variables,\n\nLine 182 (assuming the appropriate assignee here is `AZKUBE_DOCKER_PARAMS`)\n\n```\ndocker_params+=(\"--net=host\" \"--env=https_proxy=${AZURE_HTTPS_PROXY}\")\n```\n\nLine 186 (assuming the appropriate assignee here is `AZKUBE_RESOURCE_GROUP_PARAM`)\n\n```\nresource_group_params+=(\"--resource-group=${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_PARAM}\")\n```\n\nAnd it goes on to export the above variables on Line 191\n\n```\n export AZKUBE_AUTH_PARAMS\n export AZKUBE_DOCKER_PARAMS\n export AZKUBE_RESOURCE_GROUP_PARAM\n```\n\nHowever, in GNU Bash 4.3 (on Ubuntu 16.04), the bash manual states, under the `BUGS` section, \n\n```\nArray variables may not (yet) be exported.\n```\n\nWhich means the above `AZKUBE_*` variables likely aren't being exported properly.\n\nTrue enough, inserting an `env` or `export` in `azure-deploy()` under the `get-common-params` call, shows that the `AZKUBE_*` variables do not exist in the environment immediately prior to running the `colemickens/azkube` container.\n\nThis seems to break `kube-up.sh` when wanting to setup a cluster in a particular Azure Resource Group. The cluster comes up just fine, just that `kube-up.sh` doesn't see the user-defined Resource Group name, and attempts to set its own based on the assigned deployment id.\n\nExpected:\n\nSetting `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_PARAM` (it's listed as `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` in the docs), then calling `kube-up.sh` should set up the cluster within the given Resource Group\n\nActual:\n\nThe `kube-up.sh` script doesn't seem to receive the value set in `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_PARAM` and creates a new resource group with a name based off the assigned `AZURE_DEPLOY_ID`, which is very unexpected.\n",
