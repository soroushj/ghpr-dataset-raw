Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nWhile revising clients of `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/wait/wait.go` I noticed that some comments there are misleading or confusing or incomplete.  I am looking https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/blob/8ca64af22337b053ca4477f52d2fb15ebde43eee/pkg/util/wait/wait.go , which is in the latest commit in `master` at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe comment on the `Backoff` field named `Factor` says it must be greater than or equal to zero.  The comment does not call out any special meaning for zero.  The `Step` method tolerates any value in the `Factor` field, but treats zero irregularly (taking it to mean roughly the same thing as 1).\r\n\r\nThe comments about `Jitter` all say that it is applied _after_ `Cap`, and give no other information.  The `Step` method reveals that there is a broader and clearer thing to say.  There is logic that determines the progression of values for `Duration`, and at each step the jitter is added to the returned value after the update (if any) to `Duration`.\r\n\r\nThe comment on `Steps` says flatly that it is \"The number of steps before duration stops changing\".  But this is not true; `Duration` _also_ stops changing once it hits `Cap`.  The comments on `Steps` and `Cap` should more clearly indicate that they are peers in determining when the increases in `Duration` stop.\r\n\r\nThe comment on `Cap` says \"The returned duration will never be greater than cap *before* jitter is applied\", but this is not true in the `Step` method.  When `Steps < 1`, `Cap` is ignored.\r\n\r\nThe comment on `Steps` only says it is used to determine when to stop changing `Duration`.  The `ExponentialBackoff` function interprets `Steps` as a limit on the number of iterations (making its effect of limiting `Duration` increases moot).\r\n\r\nThe comment on the `ExponentialBackoff` function says \"It checks the condition up to Steps times\" but this is not true.  If the `Duration` hits the `Cap` earlier than that, the iteration is cut short.",
