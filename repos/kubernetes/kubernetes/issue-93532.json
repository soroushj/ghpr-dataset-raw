  "body": "**Background**:\r\n\r\nWe recently introduced Guaranteed Pod QOS on jobs running in `k8s-infra-prow-build` GCP project (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/18471). Introducing limits on jobs naturally started causing some failures, one of which was `verify-master` ([testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#verify-master)). The original memory limit of `46Gi` caused the pod to be unscheduleable, so it was bumped down to `42Gi` (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/18502) at which point the pod became scheduleable and the job ran successfully ([job run](https://prow.k8s.io/view/gcs/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-verify-master/1288169770910224385)). At that point, after observing metrics, I mistakenly concluded that this was much higher than needed and suggested bumping down again (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/18502#issuecomment-665191173). This caused the job to continue to run, but to fail on `verify.typecheck` and sometimes `verify.typecheck-dockerless`.\r\n\r\n`test/typecheck` was recently refactored to not depend on GOPATH (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92212). This was a fairly significant change so I looked at the metrics before and after the rewrite was merged.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`verify-* pre-merge` (June 25th)\r\n![pre-merge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31777345/88804188-2c209b00-d173-11ea-9055-9fa33bf9cb3c.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`verify-* post-merge` (June 27th)\r\n![post-merge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31777345/88804361-6b4eec00-d173-11ea-9e4d-37170c511139.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory usage nearly double for `verify-master` post-merge, which appears to be directly related to the rewrite given that `verfiy-*` on other branches remained relatively constant. This can be affirmed further by the fact that `verify-master` and `verify-beta` are failing with the new resource limits, while older release branches are not.\r\n\r\nI can see a few options for how we may be able to remedy this issue in the short term:\r\n- Revert the rewrite to get back to lower (yet still very high) memory usage\r\n- Separate `typecheck` into a separate job to not reduce signal on the rest of `verify-master`\r\n- Bump memory limits back up to `~42Gi` to get this running successfully again for now\r\n\r\nI plan to look into fixing up `typecheck` but think it would be a good idea to take one of the directions mentioned above if this cannot be remedied quickly.\r\n\r\n/priority critical-urgent\r\n/sig testing\r\n/cc @kubernetes/ci-signal @thockin @liggitt @spiffxp @BenTheElder \r\n",
