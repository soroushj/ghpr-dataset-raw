  "body": "/kind feature\r\n\r\nHere are the possible code cleanup/refactoring we have discussed during device plugin PR code review or offline:\r\n1. Currently Kubelet side device plugin is structured as three-layers: cm.DevicePluginHandler -> deviceplugin.Manager -> deviceplugin.endpoint. We may improve code readability by dropping them to two: cm.DevicePluginHandler -> deviceplugin.Endpoint. Some of the functionalities of deviceplugin.Manager will be moved to cm.DevicePluginHandler and some may be moved to deviceplugin.Endpoint.\r\n2. The current deviceplugin.Endpoint has two methods: list and listAndWatch that make the same gRPC call. We may merge them into one. Combined with 1) item, the deviceplugin.Endpoint interface may expose the following methods: Start(), Stop(), Alloc(), run().\r\n- Interface cleanup: some of the interfaces in deviceplugin pkg is not necessary public and can be changed to internal.\r\n- Most functions in deviceplugin/utils.go doesn't seem to be necessary. May consider to remove this file.\r\n",
