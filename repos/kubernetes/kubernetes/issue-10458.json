  "body": "I find it curious that this doesn't already exist. I assume there is a reason for that but I couldn't find any references for it. What is the reason?\n\nIf there is hope of adding custom gke scopes, I'd be happy to submit a PR, but I'd like some feedback first. I noticed notes for @mbforbes like \"Refactor setting scope flags.\" What refactor was in mind? Currently scopes are set in the MINION_SCOPES variable which is a bash array. Because it's an array it needs a join_csv function. But as far as I can tell, the variable is never \"pushed\" or \"popped\" so I see no benefit from using the array. Although if we eventually want to push e.g. monitoring, logging scopes onto the array, we should keep it. Alternatively it might be easy to just concat comma-separated strings.\n\nI don't mean to bike shed here, I'd just like to do the simplest PR that will be accepted and enable custom scopes in gke.\n",
