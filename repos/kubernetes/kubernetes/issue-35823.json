  "body": "Addon Manager was broken a few times recently by some indirect-related changes(like #35255) made in the code base. Addon Manager's logs would be very helpful for narrowing down the problem. And I don't think there is an obvious way to retrieve Addon Manager's logs for Jenkins tests currently.\n\nThis can be achieved in the same way as what we did for the components like `kube-proxy` and `kube-apiserver` (mounting /var/log). I will try it through this way for addon manager.\n\ncc @mikedanese \n",
