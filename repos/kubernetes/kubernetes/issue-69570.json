This can cause those tests to fail on Windows nodes.\r\n\r\nSome of the tests are:\r\n\r\n    [sig-network] Networking Granular Checks: Pods should function for node-pod communication: http [NodeConformance]\r\n    [sig-network] Networking Granular Checks: Pods should function for node-pod communication: udp [NodeConformance]\r\n    [sig-network] Networking Granular Checks: Services [Slow] should function for node-Service: http\r\n    [sig-network] Networking Granular Checks: Services [Slow] should function for node-Service: udp\r\n    [sig-network] Networking Granular Checks: Services [Slow] should update nodePort: http [Slow]\r\n    [sig-network] Networking Granular Checks: Services [Slow] should update nodePort: udp [Slow]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should support a 'default-deny' policy [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should enforce policy based on PodSelector [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should enforce policy based on NamespaceSelector [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should enforce policy based on Ports [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should enforce multiple, stacked policies with overlapping podSelectors [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should support allow-all policy [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should allow ingress access on one named port [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n    [sig-network] NetworkPolicy NetworkPolicy between server and client should allow egress access on one named port [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nThe commands used by those tests should be platform agnostic, so they can pass using Windows Nodes as well.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nRun the mentioned tests using Windows Nodes.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): v1.12.0-rc.2\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: N/A\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Windows Server 1803 compute nodes\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): N/A\r\n- Install tools: N/A\r\n- Others:\r\n",
