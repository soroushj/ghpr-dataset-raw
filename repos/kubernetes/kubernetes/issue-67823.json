  "body": "After https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62111 has been merged, our large tests started behaving a bit strange. In particular, when 5k node cluster was reported as up (with all nodes being ready), the test itself was only discovering 4k or even less nodes as schedulable.\r\nExample is here:\r\nhttp://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-e2e-gce-scale-performance/192/\r\n\r\nThere were a couple issues that were fixed in the meantime by @mborsz mostly he fixed validation: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67766\r\n\r\nThat said, that issue clearly shows that tainting nodes by conditions visibly slows down the startup, because now, once the condition are reported as \"healthy\" the node has to be processed by nodelifecycle controller to remove the corresponding taints.\r\n\r\nI didn't yet take a look if the problem here is its throughput or is it related to the fact that there are so many nodes to process at once, but given my experience in the past, I suspect that it may be serialized processing with reporting that in a single thread...\r\n\r\n@k82cn @bsalamat @kubernetes/sig-scalability-bugs \r\n@shyamjvs @mborsz ",
