Thanks!-->\r\n\r\nRelated to #14995, there remains a leak in `wait.PollUntil()` which does not ensure the channel it passes to `WaitFor` is closed. This causes goroutines to leak under common scenarios, such as when calling `cache.WaitForCacheSync()`.\r\n\r\n/cc @ncdc \r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nEach call to `wait.PollUntil` leaks an active goroutine (in this case spawned by `wait.poller()` via `wait.WaitFor()`. The goroutine will not end until the `stopCh` passed to `PollUntil` is closed - however this requirement can and should be handled internally. Often callers will pass a context with a longer lifespan.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n`wait.PollUntil` should ensure that the polling goroutine is ended after its condition is met. This can be accomplished by creating a new channel with a child cancellation relationship to the original, and passing that on instead. This child channel can be closed once `WaitFor` returns.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nThe minimal reproduction would be to call `wait.PollUntil` with a true condition, and not close the passed `stopCh`. However, a more complete reproduction involving a `ShareInformer` can be seen [here](https://github.com/shomron/poll-leak/blob/master/main.go).\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nThis leak was discovered in practice and caused a steady leak of memory and cpu in a project I work on.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"12\", GitVersion:\"v1.12.2\", GitCommit:\"17c77c7898218073f14c8d573582e8d2313dc740\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2018-10-30T21:39:16Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.11.1\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"darwin/amd64\"}\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"10+\", GitVersion:\"v1.10.7-gke.11\", GitCommit:\"fa90543563c9cfafca69128ce8cd9ecd5941940f\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2018-11-08T20:22:21Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.9.3b4\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\n```\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: Google GKE\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): n/a\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): n/a\r\n- Install tools: n/a\r\n- Others: n/a\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\r\n/kind bug",
