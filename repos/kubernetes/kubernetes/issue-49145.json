  "body": "/kind bug\r\n\r\nA quota-limited user put a large number for replicas in a replica set.\r\n\r\n**What happened**: The controller attempted to start 500 pods even though the quota only allowed 5 pods. A large number of requests were made for each controller pass, and an enormous volume of failure events was generated.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**: The controller should realize that pod creation is failing and skip the later pod creation attempts.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n1. Create a namespace and add a quota to the namespace\r\n```kubectl create quota my-quota --hard=pods=5```\r\n2. Create a replica set in the namespace with a number that far exceeds the quota\r\n3. Watch the controller logs and events\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nFix in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/49142",
