  "body": "We create the stdin stream and immediately start copying local stdin to the container. We do the same for stdout and stderr (create stream, start copying immediately). In the kubelet, we wait to receive all the streams before we start the exec and copy between the streams and the container.\n\nThe spdy connection frame handling code has 5 frame workers, each with a queue of up to 50 frames. In the event that we try to push more than 50 frames to a single queue before all streams are ready, the 51st attempt to push a frame blocks until there is space available in the queue. But there won't be any space until the server starts reading from the streams, which won't happen until all the streams have been received, so we're stuck at this point.\n\nThe fix is to create all the streams first, and only start copying after all the streams have been created and the server is ready to copy between the streams and the container.\n\nOriginally reported here: https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/5377\n",
