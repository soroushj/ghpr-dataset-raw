Before hitting the button, please answer these questions.-->\n\n**Is this a request for help?** (If yes, you should use our troubleshooting guide and community support channels, see http://kubernetes.io/docs/troubleshooting/.):\n\nNo\n\n**What keywords did you search in Kubernetes issues before filing this one?** (If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there.):\n\ndnsmasq log\n\n---\n\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one):\nFEATURE REQUEST\n\n<!--\nIf this is a BUG REPORT, please:\n  - Fill in as much of the template below as you can.  If you leave out\n    information, we can't help you as well.\n\nIf this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:\n  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.\n\nIn both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely\nmanner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we\nmight close your issue.  If we're wrong, PLEASE feel free to reopen it and\nexplain why.\n-->\n\n**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):\n\n1.3.4\n\n**Environment**:\n- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: bare-metal\n- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CoreOS 1068.8.0\n- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): Linux $REDACTED 4.6.3-coreos #2 SMP Mon Jul 18 06:10:39 UTC 2016 x86_64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5530 @ 2.40GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux\n- **Install tools**: bootcfg and ignition\n- **Others**:\n\n**What happened**:\n1. I started kube-dns according to this example: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/dns/skydns-rc.yaml.base\n2. `kubectl logs --tail=100 -f kube-dns-v19-????? dnsmasq` did not show anything.\n\n**What you expected to happen**:\n\n`kubectl logs --tail=100 -f kube-dns-v19-????? dnsmasq` should have shown log messages. There should have been at least a start-up message and it should possibly also log DNS requests, as does the `kubedns` container.\n\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\n\nTake the example `kube-dns-rc.yaml` and create a resource controller from it.\n\n**Anything else do we need to know**:\n\nFor my DHCP/TFTP dnsmasq pod these command line switches have the desired effect: `--keep-in-foreground --log-facility=-`\n",
