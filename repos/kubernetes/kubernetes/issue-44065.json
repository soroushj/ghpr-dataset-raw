  "body": "## Motivation\r\nclient-go currently has its own copy of API types. This causes problems like \r\n* client-go users cannot reuse kubernetes utilities functions because the types don't match.\r\n* we cannot remove the staging folder and develop in the client-go directly, because otherwise duplicate PRs are required to update API types.\r\n* kubernetes vendors repos like k8s.io/metrics, k8s.io/heapster, which vendor types in k8s.io/kubernetes and thus creating vendor circle. Moving external API to k8s.io/api breaks the circle.\r\n* more discussion in\u3000https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/41629\r\n\r\n##  What belongs in k8s.io/api\r\n\r\n### What's included\r\n* types.go for external versions\r\n* methods of the types (e.g., https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/api/v1/resource.go)\r\n\r\nGenerated code:\r\n* deepcopy, since https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36412 is going to make it a method of the type.\r\n* generated.proto\r\n* generated.pb.go (because it defines methods of the types)\r\n* types_swagger_doc_generated.go (because it defines methods of the types)\r\n* types.generated.go (because it defines methods of the types)\r\n\r\n### What's NOT included\r\n1. validation and defaults: they are part of the API, but should only be used by the apiserver, so we don't publish them.\r\n2. internal (unversioned) types: they are only needed by apiserver\r\n3. conversions: they are only needed by apiserver and use internal types\r\n\r\n### Undecided:\r\n1. helper functions (pkg/api/v1/helpers.go, pkg/api/v1/pod/util.go, etc.,). They probably belong to k8s.io/api because: 1. these functions are necessary to write controllers; 2. they are closely related to the API types, so should be stable as long as the APIs are. We are not moving them this time because we are not 100% sure, it would be hard to \"unexport\" them.\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\nThese steps needed to be taken in order:\r\n\r\n- [x] we don't want to copy the global [Scheme, Registry, Codecs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/api/register.go#L31-L45) to the new repo. These global variables should be replaced by variables per-binary. To prevent people from creating more dependencies, update the bazel rules to control the visibility of `kubernetes/client-go/pkg/<api, apis>`. Update: we removed the invocation where we could, or we used the copy in kubernetes/kubernetes. This step was proved non-trivial.\r\n\r\n- [x] A few code generators assume the input and output will be both at `kubernetes/kubernetes/pkg/<api,apis>`, we needed to update them to allow different input/output locations. Such code generators include: deepcopy-gen, default-gen, conversion-gen, proto-gen, client-gen, lister-gen, informer-gen\r\n\r\n- [x] In a single PR, create the staging area for k8s.io/api, actually move the types, actually change the configurations of the codegen, change the import path. This PR has to be merged right after code freeze, to avoid causing other contributors to rebase. (cherrypick to 1.7 branch will have conflicts though). Update: this was #44784\r\n\r\n- [x] Create the k8s.io/api repo, keep the commit history (see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41747#issuecomment-281103294), \r\n\r\n- [x] update publish robot to publish k8s.io/api.\r\n\r\n- [x] update the docs on how to change/create API given this new layout of code.\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\n* where should type-specific helper functions live, e.g., https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/api/helpers.go? IMO the new apis repo should contain as less code as possible, so the helpers should remain in kubernetes.\r\n\r\ncc people from #41629 and #41747\r\n@deads2k @sttts @thockin @lavalamp @justinsb @liggitt @ncdc @smarterclayton @bgrant0607 ",
