  "body": "When a vm is reported as no longer present in cloud provider and is deleted by node controller, there are no attempts to detach respective volumes.  For example, if a VM is powered off or paused, and pods are migrated to other nodes.  In the case of vSphere, the VM cannot be started again because the VM still holds mount points to volumes that are now mounted to other VMs.  \n\nIn order to re-join this node again, you will have to manually detach these volumes from the powered off vm before starting it.\n",
