One was under pkg/kubelet/deviceplugin that contains device plugin Manager interface, implementation, and endpoint implementations for handling the interactions with device plugin registration and updates. The other was at pkg/kubelet/cm/device_plugin_handler_*.go that implements DevicePluginHandler that interacts with ContainerManager and was mostly responsible for device plugin resource allocation and checkpointing. With PR https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54019, now all device plugin related code lives under a single directory under pkg/kubelet/cm/deviceplugin. It will make abstraction clearer to have a single public interface. One possible way to achieve this is to merge Handler functionalities into Manager and make Manager the single public interface from cm/deviceplugin package. To avoid having a giant file with too many functionalities and also to simplify locking logic of device plugin, we can introduce a data struct to keep cached device state in the new ManagerImpl, say we call it cacheStore. The cacheStore defines a bunch of get/update functions that are protected with a RWMutex. With this part separated out, ManagerImpl can call this component for all of its data state management and no longer needs a Mutex lock.\r\n\r\nWe would like to experiment these ideas with a PR implementation and see how it helps improve code readability.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n",
