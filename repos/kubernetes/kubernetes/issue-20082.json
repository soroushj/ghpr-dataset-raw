  "body": "Good day.\n\nIt would be beneficial to have Kubernetes cluster name available through instance metadata (when running on GKE), as an environment variable, or both. \n\nThe use case: In case of multiple instances of an application are running, each in it's own (development) cluster, the application needs to pull developer-specific configuration according to it's cluster name. For example, it my application is named \"burgul\" and I have developers Alice and Bob, then each of them will launch its own cluster named burgul-dev-alice and burgul-dev-bob respectively. The code running in the cluster then may want to load developer-specific parameters from external configuration service.\n\nThe full details are in the following discussion: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-containers/FK_6ySjTp7I\n",
