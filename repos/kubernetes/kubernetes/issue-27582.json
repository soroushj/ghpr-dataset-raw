  "body": "In `/test/e2e_node/e2e_node_suite_test.go`, the node services are started in the `BeforeSuite` logic. If they fail to start, ginkgo's `Fail` function is called, which ultimately initiates test tear down and thus the `AfterSuite` logic in the same file.\n\nThe `AfterSuite` logic calls `e2es.stop()` (defined in `test/e2e_node/e2e_service.go`), which will try to e.g. `es.stopService(es.kubeletCmd)`, where `es` is the `e2eService` and `kubeletCmd` is the `*killCmd` for the kubelet service. \n\nUnfortunately, because the service failed to start, this pointer is nil, and we get a nil pointer dereference in the `Kill` function (in `test/e2e_node/e2e_service.go`). \n\nOff the top of my head, I see two potential solutions to this problem.\n1. Pre-allocate default `killCmd` structs on the `e2eService` struct created in the `newE2eService` function in `test/e2e_node/e2e_service.go`. We could just make `killCmd.cmd = nil` on these, because the assumption appears to be that if `killCmd.cmd == nil`, the service is not running. (It appears that prior to the addition of `killCmd`, a nil `cmd` was interpreted as 'service not running,' and that this `cmd` field got rolled into `killCmd`, see 66d74f969dbbde894949b87366d215e020167faf).\n2. Or, simply add an additional check to the `Kill` function, where we assume that if the `killCmd` is `nil`, the respective service is not running.\n\nThoughts? I want to make sure I'm not missing something here.\n\n@timstclair because you added teardown code in 66d74f969dbbde894949b87366d215e020167faf\n@euank because you added `killCmd` in 34996f1b84104a83033fb62cec72ec86f9eef8c1\n\nNote: Tim is on vacation so I'm not really expecting a response from him.\n",
