  "body": "After looking at @thockin 's [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57824), I realized that there are some problems with how we're using kubemark images for our CI-testing:\r\n\r\n1. Every run of every kubemark job creates and pushes a kubemark image to the image registry of the project in which the cluster would be created. But the kubemark cluster setup uses the `<registry>/kubemark:latest` image. This means that a race b/w 2 kubemark jobs while pushing the image is possible, and it may happen that one job is using the image from another one. This can be solved by using a random image tag to uniquify the runs.\r\n\r\n2. Every run of every kubemark job pushes a new image to a docker registry. So we have a huge list of leaked kubemark images in the projects where we're running kubemark jobs - e.g O(10^5) images in [one of our projects](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/gcr/images/k8s-jkns-pr-kubemark/GLOBAL/kubemark?gcrImageListsize=50) used for kubemark pre-submit. Each image is about 72 MB and at the cost of [0.026 $/GB](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/pricing) for our GCS buckets, it's ~$180/month for that project. Another such project is of our kubemark-small job (running once every 20m) which has ~30k stale images. Overall, we're likely spending an estimated O(1000) $/month just on stale kubemark images. Few things we should do IMO:\r\n  - delete the kubemark image at the end of the run\r\n  - delete the pre-existing stale kubemark images\r\n  - in general, make janitor garbage collect images also (cc @krzyzacy @BenTheElder )\r\n\r\n3. PR https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57824 changed the kubemark image registry to `staging-k8s.gcr.io`, instead of the earlier `gcr.io`. However, the manifest for the kubemark deployment [hasn't been updated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3586986416b174d390376311c909d665416bf5c0/test/kubemark/resources/hollow-node_template.yaml#L38) - so all jobs will continue using old kubemark image (albeit the `:latest` one). This needs to be fixed asap.\r\n\r\ncc @wojtek-t @porridge @kubernetes/sig-scalability-bugs \r\n/assign",
