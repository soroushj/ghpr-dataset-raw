  "body": "/kind bug\r\n/sig api-machinery\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n`ToUnstructured()` method in converter from `apimachinery/pkg/conversion/unstructured` assumes the destination map is empty. I almost introduced a bug where I expected it to overwrite contents of the map I have - I think this is a natural thing to expect, isn't it? This is a landmine IMHO.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nMap contents should be fully overwritten. Looking at all the usages in k8s codebase, an empty map is always created before this method is invoked. Why not make this method return a freshly allocated map instead of taking it as an argument?\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nSee https://github.com/atlassian/kubernetes/commit/07bdb170001534c208303350cae4d4173cd32571\r\nTest output:\r\n```shell\r\nconverter_test.go:480: Unexpected dest size received from ToUnstructured: 1: map[a:1]\r\nconverter_test.go:498: Unexpected dest received from ToUnstructured: map[a:1 b:2]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\nHEAD\r\n",
