  "body": "**What would you like to be added**:\r\nLatency of volume operations like provisioning a volume has been evaluated as following:\r\n1. for in-tree implementation, latency is recorded ONLY for one-retry loop which could be not accurate, i.e., when the first retry actually fails while the following attempt succeeded.\r\n2. via CSI, as its async nature, i.e. [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go#L1404], the call for provisioning will return immediately and making the latency metrics recording at [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go#L1348](url) not accurate.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been brought up in [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/75782](url), creating a separate issue to track the effort for enhance it in the current controller after discussion with @msau42 as itself seems to be big enough.\r\n\r\nWithin this enhancement, looking to have two stages:\r\n1. provide accurate volume provisioning/deletion latency metrics for CSI workflow\r\n2. discuss with sig/storage to see whether it is worth enhancing existing in-tree implementation\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\nTo provide more accurate volume operation latency metrics for provisioning/deletion for a better user experience.\r\n",
