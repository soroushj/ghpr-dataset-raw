  "body": "The Rackspace integration broke the GCE deploy.  With Debian Wheezy the jinja2 version (package python-jinja2) is jinja2 version 2.6.  This doesn't have support for the `map` filter used in `cluster/saltbase/salt/apiserver/default`.  Even though we don't hit that case for GCE, jinja apparently verifies the entire file.\n\nThe VMWare folks hit this too and worked around it with a funky loop.  We probably need to use the same logic for rackspace.\n\n(The jinja2 version comes from the debian repository instead of pypi as installed by the salt bootstrap scripts.  We might be able to grab a newer version for GCE but that seems more difficult.)\n",
