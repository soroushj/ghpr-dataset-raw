  "body": "  Now that the \"secrets\" type has been merged, and we have namespaces, I don't think it often makes sense to give blanket readonly access to objects.  So, lets deprecated it.\n\nI don't know that we want to rip it out all in one go.\nNothing is using the `kubernetes-ro` service as far as I can see from searching the codebase, however some customers might depend on it, and maybe openshift does.  For GKE, I think we'd like it gone.  So, lets add a flag to the master that disables its creation.  If a customer needs it we can tell them how to get it back, but it will discourage new uses.\n\nOnce service-accounts land, we can give people that need it a way to automatically generate policy and credentials for things in pods.  Then we can delete `kubernetes-ro` it altogether.\n",
