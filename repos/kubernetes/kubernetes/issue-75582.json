Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nAzure cloud provider configures securityGroup, routeTable and loadBalancer by invoking ARM APIs. But on cluster initialization stage, it may update them even when the create operation from provisioning tools doesn't finish. Because the later PUT would cancel a previous ongoing one, this would introduce troubles for provisioning tools.\r\n\r\nWe should check the status of securityGroup and routeTable, and only do updates for them when they are in state `Succeeded | Failed | Canceled`.\r\n\r\nAlso for a running cluster, other components may also update those resources. So ETAG for each resource should be honored when the cloud provider updates them.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nCloud provider shouldn't cancel operations from provisioning tools.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n\r\n/sig azure\r\n/kind bug\r\n/priority important-soon\r\n/milestone v1.15",
