  "body": "From the recent runs of different scalability tests, I have a hypothesis that we are not reusing connections after \"429\" error is returned to the client.\n\nHere is description of one tests that I've seen failed:\n1. basically in 2000-node kubemark all watches were dropped at some point (that's a separate issue #30873 that is a bit unrelated here).\n2. what happened next is that basically all watchers decided to do list + watch, and obvious a bunch of lists failed with 429 error (this is still expected). And we started retrying them.\n And this is still ok.\n3. Since that point, apiserver started consuming ~30 cores (which also isn't completely unexpected).\n4. But what IS unexpected to me, is that looking into profile ~70% of the CPU (which was ~20 cores) were spend in \"doFullHandshake\".\n And this is a bit strange to me.\n\n Do we do something specific on 429 errors (e.g. close the connection) so that we won't be able to reuse it in the future?\n Or do you have any other hypothesis, why we were mostly doing \"full handshakes\" at that time?\n\n@krousey @lavalamp @caesarxuchao @kubernetes/sig-api-machinery \n",
