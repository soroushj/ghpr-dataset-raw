It looks like this goroutine does not exit when we hit the above mentioned error, and continued to work, and running \"resync\" more frequently.\n\n**What you expected to happen**:\n\nThe resync goroutine must be terminated when watch is closed (i.e., ListAndWatch function returned), instead of leaking it.\n\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\n\nI just run our controller for ~15 minutes.  I'm not sure why \"401: The event in requested index is outdated and cleared (the requested history has been cleared\" happens, but from the issues I read, it should be harmless.\n\n**Anything else do we need to know**:\n",
