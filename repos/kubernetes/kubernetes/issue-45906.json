Before hitting the button, please answer these questions.-->\r\n\r\n**Is this a request for help?** (If yes, you should use our troubleshooting guide and community support channels, see http://kubernetes.io/docs/troubleshooting/.): No\r\n\r\n\r\n**What keywords did you search in Kubernetes issues before filing this one?** (If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there.): hexCIDR and CIDR\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one): BUG REPORT\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf this is a BUG REPORT, please:\r\n  - Fill in as much of the template below as you can.  If you leave out\r\n    information, we can't help you as well.\r\n\r\nIf this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:\r\n  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely\r\nmanner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we\r\nmight close your issue.  If we're wrong, PLEASE feel free to reopen it and\r\nexplain why.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): latest on master\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: Bare-metal, 3 node config using KubeAdm\r\n- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CentOS 7\r\n- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): Linux devstack-77 3.10.0-514.10.2.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Mar 3 00:04:05 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n- **Install tools**: KubeAdm\r\n- **Others**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nInvestigating the code, hexCIDR() expects the CIDR passed to be for an IPv4 address and doesn't support an IPv6 CIDR.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nSupport either IPv4 or IPv6 CIDRs.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know**:\r\nWill be working on a solution for this. Note: In some of the call paths, a PodIP string is used and passed in as a CIDR with a \"/32\" appended. At some point, this would need to be updated as well, to use \"/128\" if an IPv6 PodIP was used.\r\n\r\n",
