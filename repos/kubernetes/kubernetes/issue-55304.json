  "body": "Follow-up of https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44065\r\n\r\nInternal API types live in pkg/apis/<group>, with the exception of the core group which traditionally lives in pkg/api. In contrast, with the [move of the external types to k8s.io/api](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/282), the external core types were aligned with the other groups, forming a k8s.io/api/core package. The internal core types though were kept in our unicorn pkg/api package.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe package pkg/api served long as a catch-all package for everything around the api. There is no clear distinction between the core types and the kube-apiserver plumbing around or the helpers only used by controllers. To continue our code layering efforts, moving the core types to pkg/apis/core removes a big part of pkg/api out and makes further refactoring of pkg/api much easier and much more obvious.\r\n\r\nMid-term, one of the goals of the code layering efforts is to cut out the kube-apiserver with all its dependencies. This PR is one step into that direction, turning pkg/apis into a self-contained entity in the code-base, distinct from plumbing them into an apiserver or using them in controllers. Clear dependencies will allow us to split apart the code base on api group boundaries much easier.",
