  "body": "The quota is charged when an object is created, no matter if it's initialized or not. It has two problems:\r\n\r\n* The quota replenish controller doesn't list/watch uninitialized objects, so it misses the deletion of uninitialized objects and leaks quota.\r\n\r\n* The quota controller does periodic resync to recalculate the quota usage. It doesn't see the uninitialized objects, and will wrongly replenish the quota for yet-to-initialize objects.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51749 makes most quota to be charged after the objects are initialized. But the object count quota is still (and ought to be) charged when an object is created, so it still suffers the above problems.",
