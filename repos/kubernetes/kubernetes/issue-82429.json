  "body": "When running aggregated apiservers that want to automatically get their authentication configuration from `kubectl get -n kube-system configmap/extension-apiserver-authentication`, the \"last one wins\" behavior means that you can end up in cases where the aggregated apiserver trusts server-two, but not server-one.  We can address this by having kube-apiservers add their unique information to the configmap and not stomp.\r\n\r\nAdding via a control loop and not removing values, means that when a new kube-apiserver wants to use a different CA to sign its aggregator-proxy-client-cert, both CAs could be in the list.  Later, if a cluster-admin wants to tighten the list, he could do so by either deleting the entire configmap and letting the control loops bring it back (very easy) or by manually removing pieces of the configmap (harder, possibly technically better, but practically it won't matter much).\r\n\r\nThis satisfies the need of aggregated apiservers to deal with old and new configurations and still allows for revocation and removal of old values.",
