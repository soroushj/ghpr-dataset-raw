  "body": "PV controller appears to be processing same object multiple times for same PVC delete event. The reason is mainly because when a PVC is deleted and PV is synced(either because of an event or because of resync), then each update to PV object causes another event which gets processed until PV object is removed from informer/store and really marked as deleted.\r\n\r\nThis results in multiple delete requests being sent to storage provider for same volume. For example - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gnufied/942552193cc5450f7401fe25f03937a8/raw/184215d23b2fd8ec0fb490d456fe8bee0e449197/code.txt\r\n\r\nIn above gist you can see that volume deletion is being done more than once for pv - `pvc-6a3d4163-698a-40f5-83ae-16a30724d2ca]`\r\n\r\n/sig storage\r\n\r\ncc @jsafrane @msau42 ",
