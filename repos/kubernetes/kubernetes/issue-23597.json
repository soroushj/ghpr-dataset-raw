  "body": "Currently, the default behavior of revisionHistoryLimit of deployments (in other words, if spec.revisionHistoryLimit is not specified) is to keep around all replica sets. This strikes me as unexpected and unreasonable behavior - in normal usage of the deployment object, you will quickly end up with dozens of replica sets with no obvious button or mechanism to clean them up. I think that using deployments in the typical recommended way should not result in unbounded creation of replica sets.\n\nI personally vote for 1 as the default - it gives you basic rollback functionality but doesn't confuse the user by keeping around lots of replica sets and feels the most intuitive to me - but I think any number up to 5 is reasonable.\n",
