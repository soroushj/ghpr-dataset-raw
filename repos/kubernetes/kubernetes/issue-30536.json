  "body": "Any of the following scenarios can block `Namespace` deletion:\n1. If a node has a single terminating pod, it is never evicted.\n   - see deletePod, remaining will always be false if all pods are already terminating, see: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/node/controller_utils.go#L105\n2. If all nodes in a cluster report `NotReady`, no pod is ever evicted, and namespace is never deleted.\n\nThe first issue was encountered when the container runtime was corrupted on a 300 node cluster, and an operator manually attempted to delete the pod (without forceful deletion), but was confused why the node controller never fully deleted the pod after the fact.\n\nThe second issue introduced here (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24597#issuecomment-213106775) while understandable is an edge case that confuses users that are trying to validate the system.  I wonder if its an optimization that leads to more confusion than benefit.  Users expected to see existing pod killed, and a new pod created that just could not schedule.\n\n@kubernetes/rh-cluster-infra @lavalamp @smarterclayton \n",
