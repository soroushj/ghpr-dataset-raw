  "body": "Currently, for memory allocatable evictions, we sum the memory usage of pods in order to calculate allocatable memory usage.\r\nWe can get more accurate metrics by monitoring the kubepods cgroup, which contains all pods and their processes.  This has a few benefits:\r\n\r\n1. It makes calculation of allocatable usage more accurate.\r\n2. It makes the eviction manager simpler\r\n3. After on-demand metrics are implemented in cAdvisor https://github.com/google/cadvisor/pull/1779, we can also collect metrics from this cgroup on-demand, which will make memory allocatable evictions more responsive, and able to prevent OOMs on the /kubepods cgroup more effectively.\r\n\r\ncc @kubernetes/sig-node-feature-requests \r\n\r\n/priority longterm",
