  "body": "Started seeing this[1] in `apiserver`'s logs _every second_ **after** testing some deployments a few times. I don't have an exact path of reproducing this, but it's happening every time I provision (and deploy/destroy pods) my vagrant cluster of CoreOS, Rudder and Kubernetes v0.2-96-gcc7999c00a40df.\n\n```\netcd_tools_watch.go:134] etcd.Watch stopped unexpectedly: 401: The event in requested index is outdated and cleared (the requested history has been cleared [4469/3063]) [5468] (\"/registry/pods\")\nlog.go:151] GET /api/v1beta1/watch/pods?fields=DesiredState.Host%21%3D&resourceVersion=3063: (1.436931ms) 0\n```\n\nWhile this happens, k8s accepts new pods, but is unable to process them and status remains as Waiting. Restarting `scheduler` fixes the problem, only for it to appear later again. After restarting `scheduler`, the following appeared in `apiserver`'s logs 100x times and the status of pod changed to Terminated and then Running after a while.\n\n```\nlog.go:151] GET /api/v1beta1/pods/redis-master-pod: (2.872349ms) 200\nlog.go:151] GET /api/v1beta1/pods/redis-master-pod: (3.393814ms) 200\nlog.go:151] GET /api/v1beta1/pods/redis-master-pod: (5.015189ms) 200\n# x100 times\n```\n\nI'm testing the guestbook-go example on this cluster and if it matters, I'm using a script of commands to delete pods, services, and stop+rm replicationControllers altogether.\n\n[1] It appears once in a while as well before it starts appearing every second.\n",
