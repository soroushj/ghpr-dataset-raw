  "body": "This is an off-shoot of https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo/issues/146#issuecomment-83699596. I actually think that the structure of the existing `cmd/e2e` runner is wrong, and that we need to work towards getting the native Ginkgo runner working with our suite(s). This has the following advantages:\n- Right now, we pretty much just generate [one suite](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/test/e2e/driver.go#L83). We really want to target at least a second group, a stress group. We could do this hackily with `--ginkgo.focus`, but we should have a better tool.\n-  We've extended our own runner a couple of times just to add things the base runner already has. We should stop doing that.\n- We're eventually going to want things the normal runner already has, like parallelism.\n\nI'm not as well versed in the blockers. I remember part of it is as simple as the command-line flags: we take a host of flags to the tests and didn't want to take them as environment variables, but I think this one was easily solved? But I think the other blockers were just someone taking the time to actually do the work.\n\ncc @onsi @rrati @roberthbailey @filbranden @fabioy \n",
