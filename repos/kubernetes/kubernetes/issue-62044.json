  "body": "#57228 removed the ability to enable or disable individual resources, which is a breaking change (to apiserver command line flag). This was somehow merged without an action-required release note (actually without any release note), it didn't follow our deprecation policy, and it wasn't announced on any mailing list (so far as I know).\r\n\r\nThe most obvious thing to do is to roll back this PR and anything that depends on it.\r\n\r\nWe should also have a discussion about how we can catch breaking changes like this. (My own triage missed it because it didn't have the sig/api-machinery label, for example)",
