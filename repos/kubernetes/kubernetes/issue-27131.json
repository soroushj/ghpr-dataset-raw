  "body": "open-iscsi software initiators are currently broken for non-`default` interfaces due to the fact that\nthe devicePath (in iscsi_util.go) is assumed to use the `/dev/disk/by-path/pci` prefixing scheme\nfor all interfaces not named `default`.  This causes waitForPathToExist to timeout after 10 seconds\nsince the device path that it is waiting for is not the `/dev/disk/by-path/ip`\\- prefixed path that is\ncreated, resulting in host logging such as:\n\n```\nJun 09 04:35:12 kube-node1 kubelet[1427]: E0609 04:35:12.736129    1427 kubelet.go:1780] Unable to mount volumes for pod \"monitoring-influxdb-grafana-v3-cyict_kube-system(8749dff7-2dfb-11e6-a330-00163e0a0a01)\": Could not attach disk: Timeout after 10s; skipping pod\n```\n\nor K8S event logs such as:\n\n```\n2016-06-08 21:25:27 -0700 PDT   2016-06-08 21:26:36 -0700 PDT   4         monitoring-influxdb-grafana-v3-hm0t5     Pod                                                       Warning   FailedMount         {kubelet 192.168.10.11}     Unable to mount volumes for pod \"monitoring-influxdb-grafana-v3-hm0t5_kube-system(2a81fc54-2dfa-11e6-a330-00163e0a0a01)\": Could not attach disk: Timeout after 10s\n2016-06-08 21:25:27 -0700 PDT   2016-06-08 21:26:36 -0700 PDT   4         monitoring-influxdb-grafana-v3-hm0t5     Pod                                                       Warning   FailedSync          {kubelet 192.168.10.11}     Error syncing pod, skipping: Could not attach disk: Timeout after 10s\n```\n\nopen-iscsi support for hardware transports was added in the following commit:\n\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/6e46fa1fd4c6222993e4fb7d64fd694fdebb6f9c\n\nIn this commit, software iSCSI support was assumed to be done through only the use of the default\ninterface.  According to the documentation at https://github.com/open-iscsi/open-iscsi (Section 5.1.1)\nboth software and offload/hardware interfaces are intended to be configured using named interface\nspecifications and `default` is only a backwards-compatibility vehicle.  Configuration of `default`\ncannot be done via the use of `/etc/iscsi/ifaces/default` as this approach is specifically forbidden in\nthe documentation:\n\n```\nWarning: Do not name a iface config file  \"default\" or \"iser\".\nThey are special value/file that is used by the iscsi tools for\nbackward compatibility. If you name a iface default or iser, then\nthe behavior is not defined.\n```\n\nLeaving this here to help others associate various failure modes with this issue and possible resolution:\n\nIn my case I am just learning and this is my first iSCSI deployment.  My initial error was that I was\nreceiving an `Invalid Initiatorname` message at discovery-time even though I had used\n`/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi` to define a name.  This approach failed because I didn't realize that\niscsid needed to be bounced before it would pick up changes to that file.  I had defined a\ncustom `/etc/iscsi/ifaces/iface` specification and was using that to accomplish the task of setting\nmy initiator name.  I was able to unwind this mess and return to the use of `default` once I read\nthe code and understood what it was attempting to do.\n",
