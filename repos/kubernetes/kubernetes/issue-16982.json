  "body": "The Nodes test adds and deletes nodes.  This obviously causes re-scheduling events to occur across the cluster.\n\nThe nodes test verifies that the pods that it created are successfully ready and running, but it does not attempt to validate that pods in the `kube-system` namespace are ready and running.  In general, it should take a census of all pods running prior to resize, and validate that the same set are ready and running after resize, across all namespaces.\n\nThe net result of this means that the test exits with \"success\" believing that the cluster has been restored.\n\nHowever, many tests (Reboot tests, I'm looking at you) expect that the cluster is in a sane condition at the start of the test, and they have some low timeouts and other assumptions baked in that get violated if the `kube-system` pods are not running yet.  In particular, reboot only waits `20s` for all of the existing kube-system pods to be running and ready.\n\nThis is causing flakes in our reboot e2e tests.\n",
