  "body": "In the pull request Jenkins, we're running up to 8 instances of verification checks, build, unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like several of these components were not designed to run simultaneous to other tests on the same machine.\n\nIn particular, several unit tests seem to write to static file names in /tmp (or equivalent), which is a fairly easy fix. Some of the verification checks and the integration test start up etcd, however, and the etcd helper checks that only a single etcd binary is running on the host (and uses a static port for it).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nVerifying ./hack/../hack/verify-generated-swagger-docs.sh\n+++ [0929 12:56:12] Building go targets for linux/amd64:\n    cmd/genswaggertypedocs\n+++ [0929 12:56:12] Placing binaries\nGenerating swagger type docs for unversioned\nGenerating swagger type docs for v1\nGenerating swagger type docs for experimental/v1alpha1\n+++ [0929 12:56:15] Building go targets for linux/amd64:\n    cmd/kube-apiserver\n+++ [0929 12:56:28] Placing binaries\n\netcd appears to already be running on this machine (7295 etcd) (or its a zombie and you need to kill its parent).\n\n\nretry after you resolve this etcd error.\n\n+++ [0929 12:56:29] Clean up complete\n!!!
