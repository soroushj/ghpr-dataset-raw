  "body": "When a new connection is established to a local port that is forwarded to a pod, the current logic in the Kubelet assumes that an error stream will be created first, followed by a data stream (these are distinguished via a header when creating the stream, and linked together via another header containing the forwarded port). However, because the streaming library, spdystream, processes \"new stream\" frames in nondeterministic order, it is possible for the Kubelet to receive the data stream first, instead of the error stream.\n\nThe error presents itself with various stream creation timeouts and occurs most often when multiple connections to the same forwarded port occur at the same time.\n\n1 solution I've come up with is to have the client add a new connectionID header when the streams are created. When the Kubelet receives a stream, it would make sure it gets both the error and data streams for a given connectionID, where order doesn't matter. The problem with this solution is that it breaks backwards compatibility when using an old kubectl client against a new server. I so far haven't come up with any alternatives. Would this kind of change be acceptable?\n\n@smarterclayton @liggitt \n",
