As mentioned in issue #44297, in current design, after deleting PVC, the mount point was still exist on the Kubernetes node which the Pod was deployed and also the mount point could be seen from inside the Pod.And also if other Pod reuses the PV, then both old Pod and new Pod could access same mount point.",
