  "body": "/kind improvment\r\n\r\nScheduler in Kubernetes 1.9 has a new alpha-gated scheduling queue. This scheduling queue has an active queue and a list of unschedulable pods. When certain events occur, [pods are moved from the unschedulable queue to the active queue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/plugin/pkg/scheduler/core/scheduling_queue.go#L344). Scheduler should implement a back-off mechanism to move pods to the active queue with some delay when they are already tried and they have failed to schedule.\r\nFor reference, we have a similar [back-off mechanism in our current FIFO scheduling queue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/plugin/pkg/scheduler/factory/factory.go#L1133).\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling",
