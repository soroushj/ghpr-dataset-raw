  "body": "When I tested with deployment, found some issue. The steps to reproduce is \n1.  Create a deployment with the example online http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/#what-is-a-deployment\n2. Edit the deployment yaml file, just change the name of the deployment, and create a second one.\n\nAfter creating, check the deployment status. The first one is running correctly. The second one returned the error\nSelectorOverlap found deployment default/nginx-deployment2 has overlapping selector with an older deployment default/nginx-deployment, skip syncing it\nDeployment status\nNAME                DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\nnginx-deployment    3         3         3            3           3m\nnginx-deployment2   3         0         0            0           2m\n\nAlthough I didn't specify a selector in the yaml file, looks like it assigned a selector using the label name (both deployments use the same label name)\n1. Delete the deployments, both returns with error\n   error: error when stopping \"deployment.yaml\": timed out waiting for the condition\n   Check the status\n\nNAME                DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\nnginx-deployment    0         3         3            3           48m\nnginx-deployment2   0         0         0            0           47m\n\nNote the objects still exist.
