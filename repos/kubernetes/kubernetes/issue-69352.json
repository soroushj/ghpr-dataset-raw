It also deletes old svc while creating new. Restart the kube-controller-manager every 5 minutes. I could repro it in 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/weinong/bug-20181002\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nk8s 1.11.2\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.11.0\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: Azure\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n",
