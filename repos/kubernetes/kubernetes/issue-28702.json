  "body": "The `hyperkube --make-symlink` command was removed from the dockerfile in this PR: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/25693\n\nThis addition was originally proposed here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24510 \n\nI'd like to fix the problem or re-enable the creation of symlinks if none exists. Currently there is not enough information from the PR that removed them to know what the problem is. I've tested the symlink command and successfully have built hyperkube images with it enabled. Calling the kubelet symlink doesn't panic for me.\n\n@luxas Do you know how to reproduce this issue?\n",
