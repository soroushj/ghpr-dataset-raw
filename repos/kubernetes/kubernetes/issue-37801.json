As I understand it, only a PV resource can specify the FSType. But as we don't create PVs by ourself when using dynamic provisioning, we have no chance to specify it.\r\n\r\nI tried to understand the source when it comes to dynamic provisioning. As I understand it, the cloud specific VolumeSource (e.g. AzureDiskVolumeSource or AWSElasticBlockStoreVolumeSource) hold the desired FSType. For AzureDiskVolumeSource, I could not find any place where FSType is actually set. For AWSElasticBlockStoreVolumeSource, it is set to ext4 on creation and then never touched again.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that  FSType should be added to either StorageClass or PersistentVolumeClaim. I'm not sure however which one would best fit, or if it fits at all.",
