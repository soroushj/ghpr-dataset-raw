  "body": "It would be useful to be able to set the rkt stage1-image on a per-pod basis (overriding the global `--rkt-stage1-image` flag on the kubelet).\n\nA example use-case would be using the [rkt-fly stage1](https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/running-fly-stage1.html) when running a self-hosted kubelet, while using the global stage1 for all other pods.\n\nOne option might be to use annotations on the pod which the rkt runtime could parse for stage1-image. This would be somewhat lightweight in that no api-changes would need to be made. Eventually this could be replaced if/when runtime-specific pod configuration was available.\n\nA concern with using annotations is that the stage1 could essentially be running the pod with escalated privileges. It might mean that at the kubelet side, pods with a stage1 annotation would need to be rejected if they did not also contain the `privileged=true` flag (however, the annotations wouldn't be enforceable from the api-server `--allow-privileged` side).\n\n@yifan-gu @philips\n",
