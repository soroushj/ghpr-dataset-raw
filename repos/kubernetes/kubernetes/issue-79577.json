  "body": "**What happened**:\r\n\r\nWhen two or more images on a given node have the same size, their order inside the `node.status.images` field set by the `kubelet` process is not deterministic.\r\n\r\nThis problem has the side effect of continually triggering controllers which assume this list to be always equal on node updates unless images are added or removed.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nThe order of images should be stable even when two images have the same size, using the image ID as a second sort field would help this.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nChoose a node and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker commit $(docker create busybox) busybox2\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun a few times:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl get node <chosen node> -o yaml | grep busybox\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to see `busybox` and `busybox2` images alternating on the output.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nOur particular use case make it really common for multiple images to have the same size on a given node. I came across this problem while debugging slow updates to DaemonSets and finding out that the kube-controller-manager was leaking memory until it eventually dies due to OOM:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-30 at 20 27 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11041/60403616-ebbcab00-9b75-11e9-87e6-887cf8e3cd09.png\">\r\n\r\nI was able to track this leak to a large number of watched elements in memory and by taking a look at the logs with increased verbosity I figured it was due to too many Node notifications being processed by the DaemonSet controller:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-30 at 20 36 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11041/60403704-41de1e00-9b77-11e9-8aee-5d22d2b3f4d5.png\">\r\n\r\nIt's possible that other controllers in the wild that watch nodes and only ignore the conditions timestamps on updates to face the same problem.\r\n\r\nI'll send a simple PR to fix this shortly.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): \r\n\r\n```\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"12\", GitVersion:\"v1.12.9\", GitCommit:\"e09f5c40b55c91f681a46ee17f9bc447eeacee57\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2019-05-27T15:58:45Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.10.8\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut by taking a look at the code this problem also happens on master.",
