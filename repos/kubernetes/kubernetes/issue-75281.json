That means all frontend IPs would be used as the SNAT IPs for virtual machines, according to [Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections#standard-load-balancer). This would introduce troubles for various security scenarios, as there's no way to get a stable list of egress IPs.\r\n\r\nAzure cloud provider should support this scenario, and disable the outbound SNAT when outbound rules are configured by provisioning tools.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n/sig azure\r\n/priority critical-urgent\r\n",
