  "body": "We have noticed few months ago that this test flaked again(https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/12072#issuecomment-335311564)\r\n\r\n Opening this issue again to start dicussion on the test.\r\n\r\nFollowing are my observations after going through history and logs :\r\n- We are bringing up a nginx container and trying to check if <container_IP:80> is available.\r\n - While this is not a bad idea, there are many things that could go wrong because of which nginx may not come to running. Some of them could be related to underlying infrastructure on which we have no control over, some could be related to network plugin being used etc. Some were mentioned in kubernetes/kubernetes#30714 (comment) as well.\r\n    For example, the latest one failed with dial tcp 10.128.1.69:80: getsockopt: no route to host. This could be related to network setup as well.\r\n-   This makes the test indeterministic and therefore flaky.\r\n\r\nSince the goal this test is to check that a good container won't restart based on liveness probe, would it make sense to add a liveness command that checks for the existence of a particular directory that was created during container start up or something else instead of a HTTP GET.\r\n\r\n/sig node\r\ncc @Random-Liu \r\n",
