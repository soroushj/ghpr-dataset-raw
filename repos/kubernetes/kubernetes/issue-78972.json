Finally only a part of nodes'pod was deleted.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n> ds-foo's pods should be deleted by daemon controller from all unmatched nodes.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n> it occurred occasionally\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n> the latest k8s version also has this bug\r\n",
