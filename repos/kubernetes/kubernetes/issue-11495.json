  "body": "[versioning.md](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/versioning.md) describes a fanstasy that eventually needs to be enacted. I'm going to describe a super fast way to implement something, and if someone wants to do something better, they can maybe implement the infrastructure.\n\nRight now, we only push git tags on major/minor/patch releases. I'm going to propose the following changes that actually get us to that document:\n- First, `s/1.1-alpha.1/1.1.0-alpha.1/` to be [semver](http://semver.org/) compliant (minor patch to the existing design).\n- `alpha` releases are simply tags of known good hashes on `master` that we'll provide builds for on GCS in a known directory. Similar to how we're handling CI builds (which are wild wild west), we can provide a `gs://kubernetes-release/ci/latest-alpha.txt` that is the alpha build. We will literally just promote a previous git hash, i.e. `v1.1.0-alpha.0-6-g84c76d1` will become `v1.1.0-alpha.1`, and we will push the binaries for that build (but not bother for intervening CI builds - and master will broadcast `alpha.1-<y>` for some `<y>` a few commits after the stamping).\n- There are no patches on `alpha` builds. If an `alpha` build is particularly crappy, we may stamp a new one that week, but that's it.\n- We abandon the backmerge process for patch releases completely. This is necessary if we adopt [versioning.md](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/versioning.md), because the net effect of that document is that `master` will be broadcasting a `1.1.x` tag, not a `1.0.x` tag.\n- Somewhere down the line, we'll figure out a better process for `beta`. Maybe.\n",
