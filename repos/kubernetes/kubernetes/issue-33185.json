  "body": "We have requests for providing the ability to wait for specific deployment revisions. Currently, the way to wait for the outcome of a deployment is to use `kubectl rollout status` but this will work only for the latest revision of the deployment. For example, a script runs a new rollout and needs to wait for that specific revision to finish in order to continue. If another rollout of the same deployment kicks off in the meantime, now `rollout status` waits for the new rollout to finish.\n\nI am proposing a `--revision` flag on `rollout status` that will pin to a specific revision and once that is superseded, `rollout status` exits watching. Also, once we pin perm-failed (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/19343) down, we will need to reconsider the behavior of the command. We probably want it to exit as soon as lack of progress is reported and we also want to have appropriate exit codes.\n\n@kubernetes/deployment @kubernetes/kubectl thoughts?\n",
