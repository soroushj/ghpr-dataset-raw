  "body": "@bgrant0607 this is a breaking API change.\n\n@thockin @smarterclayton \n\nFrom #6105 \n\n> This should use a \"binding\" sub-resource, as with pods. We've drawn the analogy of claims and PVs being like pods and nodes - we should follow the same pattern. That seems like a significant change, so I am willing to proceed on this path as long as we have a strong promise to fix it ASAP. This is, strictly speaking, an API change (albeit constrained to ~1 consumer - you).\n> \n> As per our IRC chat, there are a lot of things this might change:\n> \n> Do we bind the Claim to the PV or vice-versa?\n> Do we move the Claim.VolumeRef to Spec?\n> Do we allow users to ask for a specific PV?\n\nand \n\n> As per the binding sub-resource discussion, I sense that we have this backwards. PersVolume.Status should host a ClaimRef and PersVolumeClaim.Spec should host a VolumeName (not ref, I think).\n\nPer @thockin's questions above...\n\nI think the PersistentVolume should own the binding.  It is 1:1 with Claims and it is more natural to query for volumes and see what's bound than to traverse all namespaces to see if a claim exists for a given volume.\n\nClaim.Status.VolumeRef (potentially changed to VolumeName, since Namespace is unneeded) can stay where it is.  That status is reconstructable by observing the bound volume.\n\nAllowing users to ask for a specific PV breaks the separation between them.  We can steer users towards some volumes (through admission control that retains some types/sizes of volumes to certain namespaces) but still not give them the exact volume.\n\nI can add the Binding subresource similar to pod, but I need some help understanding how to use it effectively.  It looks like Pod's use of Binding is still in flux (see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/plugin/pkg/scheduler/factory/factory.go#L294).\n\nTechnical advice and guidance is required :)\n",
