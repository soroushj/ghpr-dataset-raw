Before hitting the button, please answer these questions.-->\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one):\r\nFEATURE REQUEST\r\n<!--\r\nIf this is a BUG REPORT, please:\r\n  - Fill in as much of the template below as you can.  If you leave out\r\n    information, we can't help you as well.\r\n\r\nIf this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:\r\n  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely\r\nmanner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we\r\nmight close your issue.  If we're wrong, PLEASE feel free to reopen it and\r\nexplain why.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs of now in metrics.go https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/plugin/pkg/scheduler/metrics/metrics.go, we have 3 metrics, for end2endLatency, algorithmLatency and BindingLatency. \r\n\r\nThe problem with algorithmLatency is \r\n- it is a combination of predicate and priority latencies. \r\n\r\nSo breaking down this metric into predicate and priority latencies would be really helpful for performance analysis. For example, as part of the analysis after these metrics were added, we were able to find latencies when we have taints & tolerations alone. In fact, ability to drill down on every predicate and priority would be ideal but want to know other's opinions on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
