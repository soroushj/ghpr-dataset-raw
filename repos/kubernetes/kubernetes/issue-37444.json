Before hitting the button, please answer these questions.-->\r\n\r\n**Is this a request for help?** (If yes, you should use our troubleshooting guide and community support channels, see http://kubernetes.io/docs/troubleshooting/.): No\r\n\r\n\r\n**What keywords did you search in Kubernetes issues before filing this one?** (If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there.): close channel multiple times\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one): BUG REPORT\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf this is a BUG REPORT, please:\r\n  - Fill in as much of the template below as you can.  If you leave out\r\n    information, we can't help you as well.\r\n\r\nIf this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:\r\n  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely\r\nmanner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we\r\nmight close your issue.  If we're wrong, PLEASE feel free to reopen it and\r\nexplain why.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): master\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**: None\r\n- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: None\r\n- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): None\r\n- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): None\r\n- **Install tools**: None\r\n- **Others**: None\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n Panic maybe happens, since close the same channel multiple times.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else do we need to know**:\r\n\r\nin the file pkg/proxy/config/config.go:\r\n```\r\nfunc (c *ServiceConfig) Channel(source string) chan ServiceUpdate {\r\n\tch := c.mux.Channel(source)\r\n\tserviceCh := make(chan ServiceUpdate)\r\n\tgo func() {\r\n\t\tfor update := range serviceCh {\r\n\t\t\tch <- update\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tclose(ch)\r\n\t}()\r\n\treturn serviceCh\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe function Channel is allowed to be invoked many times with the same source,\r\nfor example,\r\n\tc.Channel(\"one\")\r\n\t...\r\n\tc.Channel(\"one\"),\r\nthen, it creates only one channel ch, that is, c.mux.sources[\"one\"], while close(ch) will be invoked many times.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is a bug, although the close(ch) may not be run for ever.\r\n\r\nI think discard the code \"close(ch)\" will be better.\r\n",
