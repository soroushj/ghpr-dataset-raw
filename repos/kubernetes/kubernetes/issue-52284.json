  "body": "Recently while starting a large cluster with IP aliases enabled, I observed that the CIDR allocation was too slow. This leads to cluster startup failing the validation step with some nodes unready.\r\nThere seem to be no issues on the GCE side as the nodes already have the alias IP range assigned. The issue is with cloud-CIDR-controller (range allocator is fine). It's slow because of at least 2 reasons:\r\n- processing work queue serially (unlike range allocator which does it concurrently)\r\n- blocking the main control loop on nodeSpec update (this should be done through a separate channel)\r\n\r\nI have a fix for this in progress. Besides these, there are multiple other improvements that can be made to cidr allocators. I'll file a separate issue for it.\r\n\r\ncc @kubernetes/sig-network-bugs @kubernetes/sig-scalability-misc @wojtek-t @bowei @thockin ",
