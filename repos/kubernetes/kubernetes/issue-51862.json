  "body": "Problem: GKE wants to take advantage of componentconfig for kubelet, monitoring, kube-dns config deployment. We need a way to protect these resources from user error to maintain our SLA. In our current permission model, we allow users to grant themselves system:cluster-admin (\"\\*/\\*/\\*\") and moving away from this model would be difficult. A solution would be to support unequivocal DENY form an authorizer. This could be implemented by either:\r\n\r\n* turning .sar.status.allowed to a tristate (YES, DONT_CARE, NO)\r\n* adding a .sar.status.break that defaults to false\r\n\r\nIn both cases, authorizers would need to be able to register with the union authorizer as 'critical' (i.e. authorizers that might return unequivocal DENYs).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n* The current model of the union authorizer allows for failures of individual authorizers. Failures of \"crictical\" authorizer will need to fail closed. This means the GKE api (which serves the webhook authorizer) would need to be up for the kubernetes API to be functional.\r\n* RPC to GKE API is required on every auth (although webhook authorizer does some caching). Right now if the Node,RBAC,ABAC authorizers can serve a SAR, no RPC is required.\r\n\r\n@kubernetes/sig-auth-feature-requests @roberthbailey @erictune @mtaufen ",
