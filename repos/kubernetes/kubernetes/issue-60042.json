I had only one main api-server and one aggregated api-server.  CPU, memory, and network load were not an issue.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI expected no such timeouts.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nRun the aggregated api-server from k8s.io/sample-apiserver.  Build https://github.com/MikeSpreitzer/k8api-scaletest/tree/master/flunder-watch and run more than 250 flunder-watch concurrently.  Observe timeouts in the main api-server's log.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nThe main api-server opens one HTTP/2 connection to the service IP of the aggregated api-servers and does all its proxying through streams inside that connection.  The most immediate problem is that k8s.io/apiserver, which is the basis of the aggregated api-serve as well as the main one, uses the default value of 250 max client-initiated streams per HTTP/2 connection.  See the default in https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/http2/server.go .  The generic apiserver code does not call `golang.org/net/http2.ConfigureServer`, so the default applies.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.8 and 1.9\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: local hardware\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): ubuntu\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n",
