  "body": "Anyone who wants reproducible deployments can use image digests/content-addressable-hash (image@sha256:abceouth).  In Docker 1.10, all images locally will be identified by the CAH as well as their tags.  In OpenShift, 80-90% of pods use the digest because we have the machinery to resolve to digest up front for guaranteed exact deployment.\n\nThe current implementation of node images does not expose image digests, so creating a pod that is using the digest gets no scheduling benefit.  The node should return the list of digests for matching (if two images have different tags but the same digest, they are the same image under the covers and the scheduler should prefer putting a pod referencing that digest on the same node).\n",
