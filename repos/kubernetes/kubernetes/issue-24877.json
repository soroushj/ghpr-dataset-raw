  "body": "I've run `kube-up` to create a cluster, which resulted in a `aws_kubernetes` cluster and user being created in kube-config. \n\nNow I want to run `kube-up` again with different parameters, to create a second cluster in a different AWS account. I would like to use a different name for the cluster and user for this cluster. From what I can see from the [script](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/e9c57e6970c5628f77bbd637bee1aac16fa7ff80/cluster/aws/util.sh#L1291), there seems to be no way to completely override the name used.\n\nI understand that I can use a separate kube-config file, but I don't want to do that. I want to use the same kube-config file, with multiple clusters and users, all handled by `kube-up`.\n",
