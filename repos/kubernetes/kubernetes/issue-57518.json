In this case the hostname returned the fqdn of the host and the cluster only had the hostname.  This resulted in the following warning messages when kube-proxy started.\r\n\r\n```\r\nW1220 16:46:26.875651       1 server.go:580] Failed to retrieve node info: nodes \"node07.example.com\" not found\r\nW1220 16:46:26.875785       1 proxier.go:471] invalid nodeIP, initializing kube-proxy with 127.0.0.1 as nodeIP\r\n```\r\nWhich then presents itself as pods not being able to access clusterip ip addresses with no route errors.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nWould it be better to fail to in this scenario rather than try to fall back to some default?  I spent a good amount of time trying to track down the Error messages that were a result of this before finally working back to taking a closer at the Warning message.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nStart the kube-proxy with `--hostname-override` set to an invalid hostname should recreate this issue.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nWhile I think we can chalk up this issue to mis-configuration the purpose of opening this issue is really to have a conversation about the default behavior.  I've seen several other issues filed that appear to be related to this behavior: #35641, #37414, #40653.\r\n\r\n* Would throwing an error and exiting non-zero be a better default action when the nodeIP is nil?\r\n* What use case(s) does a default of `127.0.0.1` support?\r\n* If there must be a default behavior here maybe the IP address on the interface associated with the default gateway is a better default than `127.0.0.1`?\r\n* Maybe the issue isn't in the proxier code but the kube-proxy itself should error when it fails to get node info rather than a warning?\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\nI'm not sure how much of this is important to this but here's what my environment was when I ran into this.\r\n- Kubernetes version: 1.8.5\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: Bare metal\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Centos 7 and Ubuntu 16.04",
