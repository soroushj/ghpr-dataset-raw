For example, if you are running a one-worker node kubernetes cluster (not minikube), and you want to upgrade it. Or, like me, you are running a test cluster and want to scale down to zero nodes when you're not going to be using the cluster for a while in order to save costs.\r\n\r\nIf that worker node has a deployment with a PDB, then `kubectl drain` will get stuck as it cannot get rid of the pod while respecting the PDB, which is expected; but in this case, it is a hindrance.\r\n\r\nAdding the switch will allow users to explicitly acknowledge that they want to ignore the PDBs (and accept the corresponding downtime for an application/service)",
