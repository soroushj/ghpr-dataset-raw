  "body": "Issue #9288 seems to have been addressed, at least for the userspace proxy, in the proxy code.  However, the script for creating a cluster on Ubuntu does not take advantage of this.  I have a cluster where each node has multiple NICs, and the default route is _not_ through the NIC that: the flannel network should be constructed upon, the API server should use in its advertised URL, and to which kube-proxy should listen.  In util.sh, various options-setting functions should take an extra argument, which is the IP address to use, and their invocations should pass the IP address being used for the local machine (`$MASTER_IP` or `${1#*@}`).\n",
