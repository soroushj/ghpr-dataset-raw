  "body": "In 1.9 we introduced PVCProtection feature and admission plugin - user should not delete PVCs that are used by running pods, therefore Kubernetes protects them with finalizers.\r\n\r\nIn 1.10 we added protection of PVs - admin should not delete PVs that are bound to PVCs (unless they explicitly use some force, of course).\r\n\r\nI don't want to have separate features and admission plugins for each object kind we protect, this can escalate quickly into StorageClassProtection and whatnot. I suggested name StorageProtection for admission plugin and feature. @thockin thinks that it's misleading, as we don't protect any storage, only Kubernetes API objects. What is better name?\r\n\r\n* ObjectInUseProtection - will we (or someone else) enhance the controller / admission plugins to something non-storage related? It could be useful to have a controller that prevents deletion of X when Y that refers to X exists.\r\n* StorageObjectInUseProtection?\r\n* PVPVCProtection?\r\n\r\n\r\n/bug\r\n/sig storage\r\n@kubernetes/sig-storage-pr-reviews \r\n@NickrenREN @pospispa ",
