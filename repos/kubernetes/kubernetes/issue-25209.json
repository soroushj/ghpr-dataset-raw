  "body": "`NodeStatus` currently includes a list of all images along with its size. This list can grow arbitrarily large on some clusters and it is bounded only by the disk capacity on each node. \nThe main purpose for exposing images in NodeStatus is to aid scheduling, by placing pods on nodes that already contain most of the required images. \nIf we can safely assume that the image pull latency for small images is negligible, then we can choose to expose only the largest `N` images on a node. This `N` can either be a fixed number for each node, or can be derived based on some threshold. For example, \"expose the largest 20 images\" or \"expose all images that are larger than 50MB\"\n\ncc @kubernetes/sig-node \n",
