However, its not being created in the minions...\n\nMaster looks ok...\n\n```\n[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ ls /srv/\nkubernetes  pillar  reactor  salt  salt-overlay  sshproxy\n```\n\nNothing in here though ... \n\n```\n[vagrant@kubernetes-minion-1 ~]$ ls /srv/\n```\n\nI haven't anything at all with the salt stuff, so Im not sure exactly when the provision-master.sh and provision-minion.sh have diverged.  \n\nLooks like @erictune @mikedanese @derekwaynecarr would be the experts on this.  \n",
