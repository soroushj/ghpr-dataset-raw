  "body": "We need a way to pass kubernetes cluster credentials to federation control plane (for it to be able to talk to each k8s cluster).\n\nRight now, we have a string field called `Credential` in ClusterSpec (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4e6e51dc266030fa045ac10f0239e6da8d0acd08/federation/apis/federation/v1alpha1/types.go#L43) which admins are required to pass while registering a kubernetes cluster with the federation apiserver. Federation controllers are expected to use this value while talking to the k8s cluster. But a string field is not going to be enough.\n\nLooking at how its done in kubernetes:\nkube-controller-manager gets the path to kubeconfig file as a command line flag. It reads the credentials information from that file to create a client that can talk to the apiserver. (It uses the current context to decide on which apiserver it needs to talk to if there are multiple cluster infos in kubeconfig): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ee2a0694b649941fc0c3be606746db041b75b91d/cmd/kube-controller-manager/app/controllermanager.go#L121. \n\nOur options for what we can do in federation cluster API:\n- We can use similar structs as used by kubeconfig in the ClusterSpec API object. These will be the Cluster and AuthInfo structs here:  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/13a7d92d0f50e877edeb4225f73ae106b33bf152/pkg/client/unversioned/clientcmd/api/v1/types.go#L58\n- We can add a field for path to kubeconfig file. This will require admins to copy their kubeconfig files from each k8s cluster to the server running federation api server.\n- To allow admins to use a single unified kubeconfig file for all k8s clusters, we can also add a field for which context to use in the kubeconfig file along with its path.\n\nThe second option should require the least amount of changes since there is already code to create a client given path to kubeconfig file.\n\n@quinton-hoole @lavalamp @roberthbailey @kubernetes/sig-cluster-federation thoughts?\n",
