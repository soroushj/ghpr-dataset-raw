The `kubectl config get-contexts` shows none as the current:\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl config set-context minikube\r\nContext \"minikube\" set.\r\n$ kubectl config get-contexts\r\nCURRENT   NAME                   CLUSTER                AUTHINFO               NAMESPACE\r\n          other                  other                  other                              \r\n          minikube               minikube               minikube\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, when trying to take any actions that require a context the following error is presented:\r\n```\r\nError in configuration: context was not found for specified context: <deleted context name>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen viewing the full config (`kubectl config view`) I can see that my selected context is still the one I deleted. \r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI believe there are two expectations I had:\r\n\r\n* `kubectl` should allow me to delete my current context, but not enter an inconsistent state in the process\r\n-or-\r\n* `kubectl` should either provide a warning or disallow removing your current context\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\nI believe that you just need a `kubectl` configuration with multiple contexts. I had three before deleting the context that has me unable to set a new context.\r\n\r\n* list all `kubectl` contexts to find your current context (`kubectl config get-contexts`)\r\n* delete your current context\r\n* list your current contexts again, and you'll see no contexts are created\r\n* try to set your context with one of the ones that exist (`kubectl config set-context <context that exists>`)\r\n* listing your contexts again will show none being set\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know**:\r\n* 3 contexts were configured before starting to delete one\r\n  * 2 of them were GKE clusters, automatically set up by the `gcloud` binary\r\n  * 1 is a `minikube` context set up by `minikube`\r\n* the context I deleted was one of the `GKE` contexts\r\n\r\nThe issue was resolved by manually setting my context by editing `~/.kube/config`.",
