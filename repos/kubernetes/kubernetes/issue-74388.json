  "body": "**What happened**:\r\nWhen Node's iops is full, the Node status becomes to be NotReady. The NotReady message is \"Container runtime is not ready\".\r\n\r\nAfter our troubleshoot, we found func `plugin.syncNetworkConfig()` in cni package costs more then 30s, then the runtime status health check is failed :\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (plugin *cniNetworkPlugin) Status() error {\r\n\t// sync network config from confDir periodically to detect network config updates\r\n\tplugin.syncNetworkConfig()\r\n\r\n\t// Can't set up pods if we don't have any CNI network configs yet\r\n\treturn plugin.checkInitialized()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nNode should still be in Ready status when iops is full. Because the CNI config files does not change.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nRun an application to fill disk IO bandwidth, then the Node becomes to be NotReady.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nNothing yet.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\nRuntime is dockershim. Other environment is no need to pay attention.",
