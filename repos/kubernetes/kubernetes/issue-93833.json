We ultimately fail a test if any one node is unreachable.\r\n\r\nIf we instead polled all nodes, multiple times, and collected the number of times a node was unreachable, this would \r\n- tell us what % of nodes on the cluster were broken, rather then just telling us the first node that was broken.\r\n- not break the testing contract (were still verifying intra-pod connectivity, just doing so in a way that gives us holistic cluster info)\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\nI described why this would make triage alot easier, and in general make it easier to see why tests are failing, here ...  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92618\r\n\r\ni'll collect a little more data on this to justify the decision .... as this is a conformance test so the bar for modification is higher (even if the test itself isnt changing) then regular tests.\r\n\r\n",
