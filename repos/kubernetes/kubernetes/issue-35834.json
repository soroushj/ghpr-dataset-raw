Before hitting the button, please answer these questions.-->\n\n**Is this a request for help?** (If yes, you should use our troubleshooting guide and community support channels, see http://kubernetes.io/docs/troubleshooting/.):\n\n**What keywords did you search in Kubernetes issues before filing this one?** (If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there.): `gcloud update`\n\n---\n\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one): FEATURE REQUEST\n\n<!--\nIf this is a BUG REPORT, please:\n  - Fill in as much of the template below as you can.  If you leave out\n    information, we can't help you as well.\n\nIf this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:\n  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.\n\nIn both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely\nmanner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we\nmight close your issue.  If we're wrong, PLEASE feel free to reopen it and\nexplain why.\n-->\n\n**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): all :smile: \n\n**Environment**:\n- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: GCE\n- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): all\n- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): all\n- **Install tools**:\n- **Others**:\n\n**What happened**:\n`cluster/gce/util.sh` uses the `gcloud` cli a lot and does a `gcloud components update` (in the commonly used function `verify-prereqs`) before doing things like `kube-down`. `gcloud` updates can introduce breaking changes (for example in the recent 132.0.0 release it removed a bunch of flags). This has caused cross-the-board test failures like #35654.\n\nBut this is not limited to just tests. Any kubernetes GCE users who rely on the `kube-up` and `kube-down` commands could have been broken.\n\n**What you expected to happen**:\n\nStop updating gcloud automatically. We could either warn user to have the required dependencies installed, or pin to specific versions of dependencies like gcloud.\n\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\ndownload 1.4.4 release tarball\nrun `kube-up` and `kube-down`\n\n**Anything else do we need to know**:\n",
