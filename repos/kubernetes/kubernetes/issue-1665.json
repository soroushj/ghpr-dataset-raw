  "body": "So today, cadvisor became wedged and just stopped paying attention to its socket.  Not kubelet's fault.  But when I would launch all I would get would be:\n\n```\n# _output/go/bin/kubelet --address=127.0.0.1 --port=10250 -v=0 --alsologtostderr=true\nI1008 19:24:44.645659 25797 kubelet.go:85] Connecting to docker on unix:///var/run/docker.sock\n```\n\nIt took me a bit of trolling through netstat and lsof to figure out that the problem was cadvisor being completely locked up.  kill -9 cadvisor and everything started working well.  I wonder if we should emit more messages during startup about what operation we are about to attempt, not just the results of operations, as I was blaming docker for a while....\n",
