  "body": "**What happened**:\r\nWhen the duration is **exactly** 2 years or 3 years, human readable duration is returned as `2y0d` or `3y0d`.  But when the duration is exactly 4 years, 5 years, etc, the human readable duration is returned as `4y`, `5y`, etc.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nThe format of an exact year should be consistent.  Remove `0d` when duration is an exact year:\r\n* `2y0d` should be `2y`\r\n* `3y0d` should be `3y`\r\n* Check other years... 4, 5, 6, 7... not sure if they also have the problem.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nBecause this is time-dependent, it can be difficult to reproduce via the CLI, but you can see the problem illustrated in [this unit test](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/15bb54c2d2c515ad155b90c2c2ca59eaa1cd3f65/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/duration/duration_test.go#L77) which shows the current behavior:\r\n```\r\n\t\t{d: 2 * 365 * 24 * time.Hour, want: \"2y0d\"},\r\n\t\t{d: 2*365*24*time.Hour + 23*time.Hour, want: \"2y0d\"},\r\n\t\t{d: 3 * 365 * 24 * time.Hour, want: \"3y0d\"},\r\n\t\t{d: 8*365*24*time.Hour - time.Millisecond, want: \"7y364d\"},\r\n\t\t{d: 8 * 365 * 24 * time.Hour, want: \"8y\"},\r\n\t\t{d: 8*365*24*time.Hour + 364*24*time.Hour, want: \"8y\"},\r\n\t\t{d: 9 * 365 * 24 * time.Hour, want: \"9y\"},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `2y0d` and `3y0d` test cases should be changed to want `2y` and `3y`, and the code should be changed to make that pass.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nNote, this is not a problem when the duration is exactly 1 year because the human readable duration is still shown in days.  So nothing needs to change to handle the case of exactly 1 year.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):  1.18\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:  n/a\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):  n/a\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):  n/a\r\n- Install tools:  n/a\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug):  n/a\r\n- Others:  n/a\r\n",
