This is why we wanted to have the ability to set a unique id while starting the kubelet.\r\n\r\nCurrently, [`MonitorNode()`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/02b520f0a40be2056d91fc0661c2b4fdb2694c30/pkg/controller/cloud/nodecontroller.go#L240) in the node controller only checks with the CCM if a node still exists by calling `ExternalID(nodeName)`. `ExternalID` is supposed to return the provider id of a node by its node name which is not supported on every cloud. This means that any clouds who cannot infer the provider id by the node name from a remote location will never remove nodes that no longer exist. \r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nI'd expect the cloud node controller to ask the CCM if the instance still exists by node name and provider id just like the other methods in the cloud provider interface. \r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n\r\nIt seems weird to me that we check if a node exists by calling `ExternalID(nodeName)`. I feel we should add two more methods to the [`Instances`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/cloudprovider/cloud.go#L116) interface for this purpose like:\r\n* `Exists(nodeName types.NodeName) (bool, error)`\r\n* `ExistsByProviderID(providerID string) (bool, error)`\r\n\r\nI see in some places that `ExternalID` has deprecated; however, I can't find anywhere that says what it was deprecated in favor of. Sorry if this is a duplicate of an existing issue/proposal. \r\n\r\ncc @wlan0 @andrewsykim @luxas \r\n\r\nrelated: #48690",
