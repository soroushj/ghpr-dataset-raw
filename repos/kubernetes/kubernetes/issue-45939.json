Would be awesome if Informers generator is updated to expose an additional method that does the same but also takes a namespace name as an argument. Seems to be no risk and a trivial change.\r\nI'm more than happy to make the change myself if some guidance is provided :)\r\n\r\nEDIT: additional details about the use case: I want to be able to limit [Smith](https://github.com/atlassian/smith) to only work with a single namespace because it may be run in a restricted environment where it only has permissions to work within a single namespace. That is a real use case: we have a cluster where a user (a team) gets very limited permissions - can only do things within their own namespace. However such team should be able to use tools like Smith.\r\n\r\nI had to copy-paste and modify lots of code for informers I need - see https://github.com/atlassian/smith/pull/58/files#diff-e2db373b7d288a95d41535cb69e73f7d",
