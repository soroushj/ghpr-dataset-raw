  "body": "After an unbelievable amount of time debugging the following this past week:\n\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/22045\nhttps://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/8176\n\nI discovered that I could reliably cause the `kubelet` to never delete a pod that was `Terminating` if the pod had never been started correctly because the docker image pull returned a `RegistryUnavailable` error.\n\nI verified this by modifying the kubelet to always return `RegistryUnavailable` for a particular image name.  I then created a namespace, added a replication controller that referenced the image, and then watched as the pods got stuck in \"Waiting\" state but never actually reported a reason.  I then deleted the namespace, and was able to see that in-fact the `kubelet` never properly handled the `terminated` response.\n\nI was able to fix this issue by modifying:\n\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/container/serialized_image_puller.go#L124\n\nto return `ErrImagePull` when the repository was not available.  This change resulted in letting my `kubelet` properly terminate the pod.  I think this is the correct behavior to not special case `RegistryUnavailable` since in many cases the registry may never become available (its most definitely not a temporary situation).\n\nI suspect this is the potential source of a number of instances of the namespace failed to delete flake because pods remained.\n\n/cc @kubernetes/sig-node @vishh @dchen1107 @yujuhong @kubernetes/rh-cluster-infra \n",
