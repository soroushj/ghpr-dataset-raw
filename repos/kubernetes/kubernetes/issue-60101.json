  "body": "/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nI'm running a POD with three VolumeMount (AzureDisk PVC). If I delete the pod, it gets rescheduled on a different node. The 3 disks are unmounted from the original node (thanks to kubelet) and the disks are starting to get unattached from the VM.\r\n\r\nOut of the three disks, only one was able to get unattached, it was properly reattached to the new node waiting to run the freshly restarted pod.\r\n\r\nThe other two Disks couldn't be detached. \r\n\r\nThe controller manager keeps trying to attach from this point on while never trying to re-detach.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nKube-controller-manager should retry detaching disks after failures.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n* create a pod with 3 volume mounts (AzureDisk). \r\n* Kill the running pod.\r\n* watch the status\r\nIf it works, retry\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nkube-controller-manager logs (--v=4)\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/djsly/3d934669f1a0db8f9a9a7d446f4962f9\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.7.12\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: azure\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): centOS 7.4\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): 3.10.0-693.11.6.el7.x86_64\r\n- Install tools: in-house (terraform + salt)\r\n\r\ncc: @khenidak @feiskyer ",
