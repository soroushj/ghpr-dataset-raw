( Tried this on two seperate ubuntu 14.04 vms to make sure it  wasn't something on first machine)\n\nCan't seem to get past this....\ngo get github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes\ncan't load package: package github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes: no buildable Go source files in /root/src/go/src/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes\n\nMaybe i am missing something?\n",
