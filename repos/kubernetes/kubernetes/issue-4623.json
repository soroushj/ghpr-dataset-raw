  "body": "Although the scheduler tries not to coschedule pods with hostPort conflicts, there could still be a conflict:\n1. once #4619 goes in, the kubelet could still maybe get pods with conflict. \n2. file based pods could conflict with apiserver-based pods.\n\nRight now, kubelet can detect a conflict, via the code in syncLoop, in pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go, where it calls filterHostPortConflicts().    However, two things need to change in that loop.\n\nFirst, instead of just ignoring one of the two conflicting pods, the kubelet should immediately set the pod status to Failed with an event with a useful Reason.  It should do this even for pods which requested restarting.\n\nSecond, it should do this in a deterministic way.  Right now, it is based on the order of the items as they come out of the config code.  Maybe it should iterate through the pods by creation timestamp.\n",
