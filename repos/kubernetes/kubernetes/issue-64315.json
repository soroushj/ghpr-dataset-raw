  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n/sig node\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nIf a container log is followed using kubectl or other API client, when the client disconnects, the process watching for changes in the logs does not die.\r\n\r\nThe process only dies when a new log line is received from the container (which may not happen) and the log process tries to send it to the client and then fails.  Furthermore, a inotify watch is also left open, which can potentially cause the OS to run out of watches and eventually results in `failed to create fsnotify watcher: too many open files` when the next container log is followed.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nWhen the client disconnects, the process watching the logs should die within a short time, and the inotify watch should be closed.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nThis is simplest to reproduce using a single node instance of K8S e.g. minikube\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a pod that does not constantly produce log output e.g.\r\n```\r\nkubectl run log-test --image ubuntu:xenial --command sh -- -c 'date; sleep infinity'\r\n```\r\n2. With `kubectl` watch the pod logs (for the pod just created) and leave running:\r\n```\r\nkubectl logs log-test-78ddcd7d6f-7p7hr  -f\r\n```\r\n3. On the node that has the pod check the number of inotify watches from kubelet\r\n```\r\n sudo lsof -p `pidof kubelet`  2> /dev/null | grep inotify | wc -l\r\n```\r\n4. Press ctrl-c to kill the `kubectl` watch started in (2)\r\n5. Check the number of inotify watchers again by repeating (3).  The number has not decreased, and will never decrease until either the kubelet is restarted, a log line is received from the pod or the pod terminates.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nI believe the problem lies in how the `ReadLogs` function works here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/logs/logs.go#L269\r\nUnfortunately this has no way of knowing if the client has disconnected until it tries to send a new log line via the `writer`, which will then fail, close the inotify watcher (via the `defer`) and exit.\r\n\r\nA container producing no log output will therefore leave the process running.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version: both 1.9.7 and 1.10.3\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: VMWare\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu Xenial\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): 4.4.0-122-generic\r\n",
