  "body": "All the code in the controller currently is in one file (a huge one and will get even huger by time). We should break it down into separate files. Something like:\n\nrolling.go (has all functions/methods related to rolling deployments)\nrecreate.go (has all functions/methods related to recreate deployments)\nrollback.go (has all functions/method related to rolling back)\nscale.go (has all functions/method related to simple scaling events)\nutil.go (has all general-purpose utilities)\n\nThere are also a couple of utilities in pkg/util/deployments that use callbacks from the controller to do things. We should have those squashed in pkg/controller/deployment/util.go. Using callbacks between packages is very hard to follow.\n\nHopefully this refactor will reduce the barrier of entry into understanding the deployment controller.\n\n@kubernetes/deployment \n",
