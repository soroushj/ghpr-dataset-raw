  "body": "When using `kubectl drain`, one node could not be drained with a message:\n\n> error: pods not managed by ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, Job, or DaemonSet: some-pod-name (use --force to override)\n\nI had a bit of a rough time tracking it down, because as it turns out, this pod was in the Completed status and had never been cleaned up by the user (which happened to be me, so I knew where to look). Finding it was made difficult by that message not saying which namespace this is in, and `kubectl describe node` not listing it either.\n\nSince a Completed pod is not actually running and won't be affected by node maintenance, I don't think `drain` should block on this.\n",
