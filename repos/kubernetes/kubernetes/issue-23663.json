  "body": "This is advantageous for many reasons, but most notably because the master has compute/rw. An nginx controller would still run as an RC in the cluster.\n\nThe biggest blocker for this is the acquisition of UIDs. The problem is one can create multiple GKE clusters within a GCE project, and simply computing a cluster local random UID is insufficient, because if 2 controllers end up using the same \"UID\" there would be a lot of confusion (i.e _not_ blackhole, but something like X% requests that get loadbalanced to the wrong backend are lost). \n\nCurrently the solution is just to throw an error if we detect nodes in our loadbalanced instance group that don't match the Kubernetes nodes (assuming another Kubernetes cluster put them there), and document how users can manually assign a unique ID to the controller (https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/master/ingress/controllers/gce/BETA_LIMITATIONS.md#running-multiple-loadbalanced-clusters-in-the-same-gce-project).\n\nThis work-around will not be possible once we run it on the master.\n\nI have a pr locally that orchestrates real UIDs in a project by using the IG name as a lock, and writing the acquired UID to a config map. It's tricky and needs testing is all: https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/680\n\n@kubernetes/goog-gke \n",
