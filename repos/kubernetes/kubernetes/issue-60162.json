  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nThe deployment controller for a `strategy: Recreate` deployment with a single replica failed to create a new ReplicaSet when the old ReplicaSet included an Evicted pod. Typically, the eviction was caused by \"node low on resource: nodefs\". When we manually deleted the evicted pod, the new RS and accompanying pod were created immediately. We have seen this happen at least a dozen times. Here are the audit logs for a recent case:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4789493/36509901-26d93d38-172f-11e8-9062-084bfc202afa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nThe deployment controller ignores the evicted pod and creates the updated replicaset/pod.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, you would need a way to trigger a kubelet-driven eviction on a node that is currently running a single-replica Deployment with  `strategy: Recreate`. Wait for the pod to be evicted and the new pod to be created, confirm that the evicted pod still exists, and then make a trivial change to the deployment spec. The running pod will be deleted, and no new replicaset/pod will be created. \r\n\r\nThis issue does not seem to occur for manual evictions (via `POST /eviction`); pods I evict that way disappear from the API server immediately.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nPossibly related to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/54525 and/or https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/55630\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):  v1.8.5-gke.0\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: GKE\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Container-Optimized OS\r\n",
