Since firewall targets are always nodes, the differences are protocols and ports. We can group firewall rule by protocol and only update ports if needed. No need to have firewall rule per loadbalancer service. This will also prevent leaks.\n- clean up firewall rules specific to e2e cluster\n\n@thockin @matchstick @kubernetes/sig-network \n",
