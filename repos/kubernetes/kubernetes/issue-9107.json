  "body": "This issue is a follow on from the discussion in PR #5284 by @piosz where folks like @pires and @eparis @nzwulfin  and maybe @derekwaynecarr complain about changing the key guestbook example to use DNS which makes it a nicer example for Kubernetes deployments that have a DNS add-on but breaks it for other clusters that don't. A very good point was made: the key example that most people try out should work on bare Kubernetes without the need to assume any add-ons services.\n\nAlthough we can imagine some post 1.0 fixes (e.g. absorb DNS functionality into core Kubernetes @thockin ) I think it is very important to get our examples and documentation in very good shape for the 1.0 release so that everyone has a very good out of the box experience with the key guestbook example for any Kubernetes deployment that we explicitly support.\n\nI propose the following approach for 1.0:\n- Produce a variety of guestbook examples which make different assumptions about the type of the Kubernetes deployment.\n- Have a `guestbook-bare` example that works without DNS.\n- Have a `guestbook-dns` example that works with DNS.\n- Have other `guestbook-XXX` examples that work with other Kubernetes deployments that can provide an alternative to our DNS add-on to achieve the same effect.\n- Produce a clear matrix in our documentation that explains which example should be run depending on your deployment.\n- Make clear at the beginning of the `README.md` for each of the examples the deployment that is expected.\n- Perhaps modify the examples to make sure the pre-requisites are available before running e.g. in a Makefile as a pre-check?\n\n@RichieEscarez @bgrant0607 \n",
