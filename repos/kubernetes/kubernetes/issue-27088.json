These cause pointless merge conflicts, one of which I just experienced and had to resolve.\n\nYou can tell git that the right answer is to accept the lines from both sides of the merge by using `.gitattributes` to select `git merge-file --union`.  I have a PR that does this and will send it in a sec.\n",
