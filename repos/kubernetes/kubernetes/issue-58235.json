Currently if a user wanted a time series graph detailing the health of their pod/container, it would not be possible.\r\n\r\nIf the results of these checks were properly exposed through a medium such as a Prometheus metric, it would highly benefit users. Using a prometheus metric would allow for integrations with Grafana, Stackdriver, etc. \r\n\r\ncc @dchen1107 @miekg\r\n",
