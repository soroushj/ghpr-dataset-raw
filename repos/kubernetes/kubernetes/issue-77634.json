Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nAs a developer, I had important questions about SharedInformer that I could not answer from the comments on it.  Colleagues also have questions.\r\n\r\nThe comments on SharedInformer mainly contain a contrast with \"standard Informer\" --- but there no longer is such a thing.  So most of the important facts about SharedInformer are not documented in the comments.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI expected to be able to understand the contract between a SharedInformer and its clients by reading the comments on that interface.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug):\r\n- Others:\r\n",
