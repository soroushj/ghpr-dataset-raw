Before hitting the button, please answer these questions.-->\r\n\r\n**Is this a request for help?** (If yes, you should use our troubleshooting guide and community support channels, see http://kubernetes.io/docs/troubleshooting/.): No\r\n\r\n\r\n**What keywords did you search in Kubernetes issues before filing this one?** (If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there.): iscsi\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one): BUG\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf this is a BUG REPORT, please:\r\n  - Fill in as much of the template below as you can.  If you leave out\r\n    information, we can't help you as well.\r\n\r\nIf this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:\r\n  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely\r\nmanner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we\r\nmight close your issue.  If we're wrong, PLEASE feel free to reopen it and\r\nexplain why.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): v1.6.0\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: Bare metal\r\n- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Centos 7.3\r\n- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`):  Linux srv02 3.10.0-514.2.2.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Dec 6 23:06:41 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n- **Install tools**: kubeadm\r\n- **Others**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nWhen using iscsi storage with multiple target portal (TP) addresses + multipathing the volume manager\r\nlogs on to the IQN for all portal addresses, but when a pod gets destroyed the volume manager only logs out for the primary TP. This leaves a session dangling and the pod using the volume can't start as the SAN doesn't allow multiple hosts to connect to the same IQN\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nThe DetachDisk method in iscsi_utils.go should do the same as the AttachDisk which is to\r\niterate over all portals and log out from all of them.\r\nAlternatively omit the -p command line to iscsiadm to log out all references to the IQN \r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\n1. Create a pod with iscsi storage and list two portals in the portals property\r\n2. Let the pod start \r\n3. Delete the pod and make sure it comes up on a new node\r\n4. You should now see a session still active on the old node against the second TP\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know**:\r\n\r\n",
