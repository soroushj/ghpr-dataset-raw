The master is running at:\n\n  http://10.10.102.153:8080\n\nUsing master 10.10.102.153\nIt looks as if you don't have a compiled kubectl binary\n\nIf you are running from a clone of the git repo, please run\n'./build/run.sh hack/build-cross.sh'. Note that this requires having\nDocker installed.\n\nIf you are running from a binary release tarball, something is wrong. \nLook at http://kubernetes.io/ for information on how to contact the \ndevelopment team for help.\n\n```\n\nI guess some validation steps are actually un-needed in ubuntu workflow? maybe we need to remove that line in the doc (at least)? @dalanlan \n",
