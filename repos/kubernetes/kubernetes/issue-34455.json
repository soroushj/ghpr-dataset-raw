If you leave out\n    information, we can't help you as well.\n\nIf this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:\n  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.\n\nIn both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely\nmanner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we\nmight close your issue.  If we're wrong, PLEASE feel free to reopen it and\nexplain why.\n-->\n\n**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): 1.3.8 custom build - the code seems to still be in place in master.\n\n**Environment**:\n- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: OpenStack\n- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): VERSION=\"14.04.5 LTS, Trusty Tahr\"\n- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): 4.4.0-38-generic #57~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 6 17:20:43 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n- **Install tools**: Custom\n- **Others**: \n\n**What happened**:\nWhen the OpenStack Nova API is not accessible Nodes are marked as \"NotReady\"\n\nThe OpenStack cloud providers seems to call Nova on a schedule to get information.\nIf the API is not contactable, kubelet fails to call back to the masters, and gets marked as NotReady.\n\nMasters also call the Nova API, and when it fails, it can mark all nodes as NotReady. \n\n**What you expected to happen**:\n\nNothing - the cluster should still work, regardless of Nova's API\n\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\n\nInstall Kubernetes using the OpenStack provider.\n\nOn the OpenStack controller stop the nova-api process.\n",
