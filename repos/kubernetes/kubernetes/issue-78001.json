We have [already added](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75848) plugin interfaces and a few extension points, such as \"[reserve](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/20180409-scheduling-framework.md#reserve)\" and \"[prebind](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/20180409-scheduling-framework.md#pre-bind)\" plugins.\r\n\r\n[Filter](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/20180409-scheduling-framework.md#filter) plugins are used to filter out nodes that cannot run the Pod. For each node, the scheduler will call filter plugins in their configured order. If any filter plugin marks the node as infeasible, the remaining plugins will not be called for that node. Nodes may be evaluated concurrently.\r\n\r\nFilter plugin interface should be designed so that all existing predicates functions can be converted to filter plugins.\r\n**Please send your proposal for the interface of this extension point before sending a full PR and let us discuss and approve it first.**\r\n\r\nThis is needed for 1.16. A PR can be sent after 1.15 code freeze.\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n/priority important-soon\r\nref/ kubernetes/enhancements#624",
