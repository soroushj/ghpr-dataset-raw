  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nI am running etcd-operator in kubernetes, and noticed that when I deleted the etcdcluster (Custom resource definition) the pods & services did not get cleaned up. I looked on another kube environment I had running, and on that env everything worked as expected. I checked logs, and could see on the env that was working I saw the following messages in Controller manager logs:\r\n```\r\nI0215 08:59:06.659783       1 garbagecollector.go:371] processing item [v1/Pod, namespace: etcd-operator, name: example-etcd-cluster-thcr8pfv89, uid: c9cdb6d7-122d-11e8-b4ac-068cfe9de373]\r\nI0215 08:59:06.659871       1 garbagecollector.go:371] processing item [v1/Service, namespace: etcd-operator, name: example-etcd-cluster-client, uid: c9d238bc-122d-11e8-b4ac-068cfe9de373]\r\n```\r\nI didn't see these in the env that wasn't working, so I started looking at the garbage collector on there.\r\n\r\nI noticed that there hadn't been any log message from garbage collecor since 31st Jan, when this was logged:\r\n```\r\nI0131 10:14:31.617880       1 controller_utils.go:1041] Waiting for caches to sync for garbage collector controller\r\n```\r\nAround this time we experienced some environmental network issues, which caused lots of errors around that time, such as:\r\n```\r\nE0131 10:13:31.691887       1 cronjob_controller.go:113] can't list Jobs: the server was unable to return a response in the time allotted, but may still be processing the request (get jobs.batch)\r\nE0131 10:13:58.322978       1 node_controller.go:1022] Error updating node 10.143.115.218: the server was unable to return a response in the time allotted, but may still be processing the request (put n\r\nodes 10.143.115.218)\r\nE0131 10:14:31.617808       1 memcache.go:150] couldn't get current server API group list; will keep using cached value. (the server was unable to return a response in the time allotted, but may still b\r\ne processing the request)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like these issues may have caused the garbage collector to get into some sort of hung state?\r\n\r\nWhen I restarted controller manager everything started working as expected.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nGarbage collector should have kept running, and working as expected.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nNot sure on the exact sequence that caused it, but suspect it was related to a time period when errors were occurring.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nWe have `--leader-elect=false` set, and had previously hit this garbage collector issue -> https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57044\r\nHowever, we are running with Kube 1.8.6 with the fix for that issue cherry-picked (commit f5d5d18b2c2320e19ea3c0697c37a95d0009e628)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n```\r\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"8+\", GitVersion:\"v1.8.6-4+9c2a4c1ed1ee7e\", GitCommit:\"9c2a4c1ed1ee7e2e121203aa9a87315633a89eca\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2018-01-22T08:23:41Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.8.3\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"8+\", GitVersion:\"v1.8.6-4+9c2a4c1ed1ee7e\", GitCommit:\"9c2a4c1ed1ee7e2e121203aa9a87315633a89eca\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2018-01-22T08:23:41Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.8.3\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\n```\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\nIBM Cloud\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\nUbuntu \"16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus)\"\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n4.4.0-78-generic #99-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 27 15:29:09 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n\r\nI will attach logs from Controller manager.",
