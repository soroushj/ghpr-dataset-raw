  "body": "Observed: hitting a service nodePort fails intermittently, but the service cluster IP works 100%\n\nDebug: tcpdump shows SYN sent, but no SYNACK returned.  I noticed that in the error case, srcip was 127.0.0.1 - clearly wrong.  We proved that the KUBE-MARK-MASQ chain was being flushed and so we were not getting SNAT'ed.  We proved it was kubelet that was flushing, and kube-proxy that eventually restored it (yay for rectification loops!).\n\nWe found the hostport code in kubenet erroneously flushes those chains when starting a pod.  After that it can take up to several minutes for kube-proxy to hit its own sync loop and fix the problem.\n\nThe fix is easy - don't flush those chains.  @freehan is working on the fix right now.\n\n@fabioy @timstclair for 1.3.x\n@pwittrock for 1.4.x\n@spxtr for reporting it concretely enough to repro\n",
