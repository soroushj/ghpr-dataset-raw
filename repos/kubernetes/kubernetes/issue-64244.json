See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/63608#issuecomment-391497458 for the evidence from my latest investigation.  It includes this line\r\n\r\n```\r\nE0523 18:59:53.086835       1 status.go:64] apiserver received an error that is not an metav1.Status: timeout\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom the `ErrorToAPIStatus` function in `staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/handlers/responsewriters/status.go`.   The relevant line is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\truntime.HandleError(fmt.Errorf(\"apiserver received an error that is not an metav1.Status: %v\", err))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still do not know the type of the error in question or where it is coming from.  It would be helpful if the log message included the type of the error object --- such as with `fmt.Sprintf(\"%T\", err)` or, if that does not include the type's package name, perhaps something that would really nail the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI would expect more information about an unexpected type of error.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.10.3\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n",
