  "body": "/kind bug\r\n/sig network\r\n\r\nI have the K8s 1.12.1 deployment with SCTP support implementation from #64973. I have faced an issue while running SCTP traffic and it\u2019s the same issue as #19029 with UPD protocol. SCTP conntrack doesn\u2019t flush entries for deleted pods. Thus associations which were established on that deleted pod can not be reestablished since conntrack still tries to route all the SCTP packets (INIT/DATA) to not existent IP. Unless the association is explicitly ABORTed from remote side (this way conntrack will delete the entry).\r\nReproduction steps are the same as in UDP case:\r\n1.\tCreate a Service for SCTP port\r\n2.\tCreate pods that bind to this Service \r\n3.\tStart a client Pod that uses the Service. This client establishes SCTP association to the Service and sends data via this assoc\r\n4.\tCheck which Pod handles all the traffic in scope of the association (collect tcpdump for example)\r\n5.\tDelete that Service endpoint by, for example, killing the corresponding Pod which the client is communicating with\r\n6.\tObserve that the Pod's IP no longer appears in endpoints (e.g. using kubectl)\r\n7.\tBUG: Observe that conntrack still NATs all SCTP traffic to deleted endpoint.\r\n8.\tWORKAROUND 1: use client Pod to explicitly ABORT and reestablish the association.\r\n9.\tWORKAROUND 2: use conntrack \u2013D to manually remove the entity in conntrack Hash Table\r\nI guess the solution will be just the same as [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/22573/commits/4fa6f3841ad362844c3c1e04c8657cacad5decde#diff-d51765b83fe795b469e8a86276b12dc9R591) and [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/22573/commits/4fa6f3841ad362844c3c1e04c8657cacad5decde#diff-d51765b83fe795b469e8a86276b12dc9R608).(reusing these functions for SCTP protocol). Basically it\u2019s just adding api.ProtocolSCTP into a couple of checks in solution #22573\r\n",
