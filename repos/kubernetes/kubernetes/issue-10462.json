  "body": "etcd cluster backing apiserver died spontaneously, after restart apiserver pulled up the pods on different machines. Node storage was backed by ext4 over rbd, which became mounted on several nodes at once. That could have possibly led to data corruption.\n\nI guess that the proper way to mount rbd volume is to take a lock on it first, which will at least fail if it's locked somewhere else, requiring manual intervention, but not destroying data. The lock should be optional, in case a proper cluster fs is mounted over the rbd.\n\nIn this case there was clearly no need for accessing the data from several pods so ext4 is deemed a proper fs.\n",
