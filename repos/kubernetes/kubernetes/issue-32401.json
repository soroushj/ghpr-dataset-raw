  "body": "pkg/util/iptables and pkg/proxy/iptables use go-semver to parse iptables versions to figure out if the iptables package is new enough to support certain features, but go-semver uses the extremely strict \"Semantic Versioning\" definition of what a version number is, and iptables has had release versions in the past that do not conform to it (eg, \"1.4.19.1\", which is illegal because it has 4 components rather than 3) and so probably will do so again in the future.\n\n(Having a non-semver-parseable version means that (1) spurious errors will be logged, (2) `iptables -C` is assumed to be present, (3) `iptables -w` is assumed to not be present, (4) the pure-iptables proxier will not be used.)\n\nkind-of related: #23854. The other semver library also requires strict syntactic compliance, so it doesn't help here. But maybe we should fork one of them and add a non-strict parsing mode? (We don't want a full rpm/dpkg-compatible version parser, but we could at least treat \"X.Y\" the same as \"X.Y.0\", and \"X.Y.Z.A\" the same as \"X.Y.Z\".)\n",
