  "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm using a GKE (1.0.6) cluster. Today, for a yet unknown reason, a node has rebooted. This node used to have a pod with a GCE PD attached. This pod is scheduled by a RC with only one replica.\nWhen the node rebooted, the pod has been rescheduled on an other node. However for some reason, the PD has not been detached from the old node.\nThe result was that Kubernetes tried multiple time to attach the disk to the new node. I got a lot of errors in GCE Operations Dashboard:\n\n```\nRESOURCE_IN_USE_BY_ANOTHER_RESOURCE: The disk resource 'projects/projectid/zones/europe-west1-c/disks/diskname' is already being used by 'projects/projectid/zones/europe-west1-c/instances/gke-nodename' \n```\n\nAt the end, the pod is in Waiting state with that reason:\n\n```\nImage: gcr.io/projectid/imagename:imagetag is not ready on the node\n```\n\n(which is not IMHO the right error message)\n\nAnd events:\n\n```\n  Mon, 28 Sep 2015 07:09:34 +0200   Mon, 28 Sep 2015 10:50:26 +0200 124 {kubelet nodename}          failedMount Unable to mount volumes for pod \"podname\": Could not attach GCE PD \"diskname\". Timeout waiting for mount paths to be created.\n  Mon, 28 Sep 2015 07:09:34 +0200   Mon, 28 Sep 2015 10:50:26 +0200 124 {kubelet nodename}          failedSync  Error syncing pod, skipping: Could not attach GCE PD \"diskname\". Timeout waiting for mount paths to be created.\n```\n\nAs this a not critical service, I'm happy to let it for a few days in this state, if that can help for debugging.\nIs there any other thing I could provide to help understand the problem ?\n",
