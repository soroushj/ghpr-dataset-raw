  "body": "There are times when the deployment system can infer that the latest deployment state has no reasonable chance of being realized (e.g. a bad or unpullable image). The current deployment controller design will continue to try reconciling indefinitely regardless of the possibly of success. If based on inference or user constraints (e.g. timeout conditions specified in an enhancement to the deployment API #1743) the system is ready to give up its best-effort attempt, the deployment could be somehow marked as \"permananently failed\" for a given spec hash so that the system won't continue thrashing on a doomed deployment.\n\nThere is a bit of functional overlap with inert deployments (#14516) in that both concepts result in the deployment controller \"ignoring\" a deployment whose state still needs realized, but inert deployments as described don't seem to capture all the context users would want in this case (i.e., it's not enough to just mark a doomed deployment intert without more context about why, and without UX safety nets to distinguish the repurcussions of re-activating the suddenly inert deployment vs. a permafailed deployment.)\n",
