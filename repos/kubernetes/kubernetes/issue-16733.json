In this case, 100m cpu.\n\nSo, if you already have 2 pods scheduled (using 200m cpu), you are at quota/limit. Then, when the deployer tries to deploy something else, you get this error:\n\n```\nError creating: Pod \"ruby-example-2-\" is forbidden: unable to admit pod without exceeding quota for resource cpu:  limited to 200m but require 300m to succeed.\n```\n\nIf you read this error, on the surface it seems to indicate the wrong thing. It talks about \"unable to admit pod\" and then says \"limited to 200m\".\n\nThe reality is that the **project** is limited to 200m of total CPU, and we're already using that much. Scheduling this pod (whose requirement is 100m) would result in a total scheduled amount of 300m, which is over quota.\n\nPerhaps a different wording could be something like:\n\n```\nError creating: Pod \"ruby-example-2-\" is forbidden: quota exceeded for resource cpu:  project limited to 200m, current usage is 200m, pod requires 100m\n```\n\nOr more generally, the format of:\n\n```\nproject limit is X, current usage is Y, and you're asking for Z more\n```\n",
