  "body": "Currently in the ownership and SELinux label management code, we do not alter volumes whose builder reports `true` from `IsReadOnly()`.  This doesn't give us quite the right decision plane; we need a new method that tells the kubelet where a volume is synthesized by the system or not.  I suggest:\n\n``` go\npackage volume\n\ntype Builder interface {\n  // other methods omitted\n  IsSynthetic() bool\n}\n```\n\n`secrets` and `downwardApi` would return 'true' from this method.\n\nThen the decision plane for ownership / selinux label management becomes:\n\n``` go\nif builder.IsReadOnly() && !builder.IsSynthetic() {\n  // do stuff\n}\n```\n\nthoughs @thockin @swagiaal @pweil- @smarterclayton ?\n",
