  "body": "During the review of PR https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51209, @vishh mentioned that \"Ideally, allocation of resources would happen as part of pod creation so as to fail pods during admission whose extended resource request cannot be satisfied by the kubelet due to any reason.\r\nFor example, a device may have just turned unhealthy and the scheduler may not have noticed it. Note there can be multiple entities scheduling pods on to nodes.\r\nNode level admission control is the last line of defence against state propagation issues in k8s.\r\nIf not for allocation during pod admission, I'd at-least like to see an admission handler (we have quite a few of them), that validates that devices are available to satisfy a pod's request. Essentially a dry run of the logic here.\"\r\n\r\nFiling this issue to follow up on this.",
