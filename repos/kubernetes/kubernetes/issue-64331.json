  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n\r\n/kind feature\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nIn our CI, we run `kubectl rollout status FOO` multiple times in parallel when we update multiple deployments. This lets us see the status of all deployments as they run.  When a deployment succeeds, the final message tells us the name of the deployment. However, the intermediate \"Waiting for rollout to finish\" messages do not say the name of the deployment. This means that in order to look at multiple rollouts in parallel, we need to manually pipe `kubectl rollout status` through another command to prefix it with the rollout name.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nEach line to mention the rollout name.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nUpdate any deployment, run `kubectl rollout status deploy/foo`, note that intermediate status names don't contain the deployment name.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nArguably another fix would be to allow you to pass multiple rollouts to `kubectl rollout status` and have kubectl handle polling multiple deployments in parallel.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\nThis is still true on master by code inspection.",
