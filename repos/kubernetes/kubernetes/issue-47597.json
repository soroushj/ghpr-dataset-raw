Upon further investigation, we discovered endpoints are not being removed when the pod is deleted. In cases of failures, the endpoint was not removed at all during termination time, until the pod finally completed (after about 10s). In other non-fatal cases we observed endpoint removal delays of several seconds. It's still not clear yet whether it's just slow to update or whether it simply doesn't remove the endpoint for some reason.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nEndpoint should be removed immediately, or shortly after (<1s), when running `kubectl delete pod my-pod`.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\n1. Observe endpoints with `kubectl get ep my-eip -o go-template='{{ range (index .subsets 0).addresses }} {{ .ip }} {{ end }}'`.\r\n2. Delete the oldest pod, wait for replicaset controller to scale up a new one.\r\n3. Wait a few seconds\r\n4. Repeat 2.\r\n\r\nWe observe the stale endpoints with kubectl, as well as directly on nodes themselves by observing iptables.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know**:\r\n\r\nThis only started happening to us recently, in the last few weeks after we upgraded to 1.6 from 1.4. It could also be related to the fact we enabled quorum reads, as we were experiencing similar types of problems with stale kube-proxy updates that we were unable to pinpoint, and thought that would help.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n* Using etcd2.3.7, 3 node cluster\r\n* About 240 services/endpoints in this cluster, spread across 7 16 core nodes (pretty small, I think)\r\n* Using leader election / multi master",
