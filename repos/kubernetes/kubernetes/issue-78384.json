  "body": "**What happened**:\r\n\r\nThe externalName of a Service is not allowed to end with a trailing dot.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nThe externalName of a Service should allow a trailing dot. This is very useful to denote a fully qualified value of the CNAME record created by the service and prevent DNS-trial-and-error by appending different (cluster-local) search domains.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nTry to set `example.com.` as a externalName for a Service of type ExternalName.\r\n\r\n**More details**\r\n\r\nThe reference reads: `Must be a valid RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123)`\r\nRFC-1123 section 6.1.4.3 also states:\r\n```\r\n            (a)  There MUST be some convention for denoting that a name\r\n                 is already complete, so that the abbreviation method(s)\r\n                 are suppressed.  A trailing dot is the usual method.\r\n```\r\nAlso in the errata of RFC-1123 a reference to RFC-1034 is added to reiterate on what a legal hostname is. Section 3.1 of RFC-1034 explains the use and validity of a trailing dot.\r\n\r\nSo while one could argue that a valid RFC-1123 subdomain may have a trailing dot, it might still be best to not change the `ValidateDNS1123Subdomain` which is used in a lot of places, but instead change the Service.spec.externalName validation locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nI'll send a PR.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Not much applicable.",
