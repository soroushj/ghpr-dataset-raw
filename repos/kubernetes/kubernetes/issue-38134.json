  "body": "**Feature Request**\r\n\r\nCurrently the Kubernetes Azure `cloudprovider` assumes kubernetes is deployed to the same Azure Resource Group as all of the dependencies. In my case our case we're interested in deploying kubernetes to a Virtual Network that sits in a different resource group to the cluster itself, this will enable us to deploy kubernetes to a subnet in a locked down vnet.\r\n\r\nI think there might be a few ways to do this. \r\n\r\n1. We can add a `vnetResourceGroup` field to `azure.Config{}`, and if the need arises to do the same for the NetworkSecurityGroup or RouteTable then we could do the same there. We could assume that if the `vnetResourceGroup` isn't provided then the cluster is in the same RG as the VNET.\r\n1. Adding support for Resource IDs (`/subscriptions/UUID/resourceGroup/rgName/resourceType/resourceName/...`). I think this is a substantial change, looking at the code.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to think the first option is best for now, as it's the path of least resistance. What do you think? When we decide what's needed I'm happy to muck in and make the changes :) \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n@brendandburns @colemickens ",
