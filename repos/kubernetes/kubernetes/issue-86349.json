  "body": "<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->\r\n\r\n**What would you like to be added**:\r\nCurrently when calculating the utilization of resources on pods the usage of all the containers in the pods is summed and then divided by the sum of the requested resources of all containers. The HPA should have a way of specifying how the utilization should be computed. If it should be the sum of the containers, or if it should be the average of the individual container utilization or the maximum of the utilization of the containers. \r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\nConsider the case when there are multiple containers in the pods, with one main container and a few sidecar containers which are over provisioned. If the main container consumes a lot of resources and is close to its requests the HPA would consider the utilization of the pod to be within limits. This would prevent scaling out. The inverse could also be true. Sidecars are sometimes necessary for the main container to function correctly. If one of the sidecars slowly down with high utilization the HPA would not scale out the target because the average utilization of the pod is still low.",
