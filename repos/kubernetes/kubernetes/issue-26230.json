  "body": "Filing this for future work.\n\npkg/volume/plugins.go defines a set of `*VolumePlugin` types that all implement small interfaces like `NewDeleter()`.  This started with `NewMounter()` and `NewUnmounter()` which plugins implement with different structs and are passed around.  It got cargo-culted into a half dozen other such interfaces that do not have the same restrictions, and generally are called like:\n\n```\nr := plugin.NewRecycler(name, spec)\nr.Recycle()\n```\n\nMost of these interfaces could be reduced to:\n\n```\nplugin.Recycle(name, spec)\n```\n\nRelatively easy one for someone to jump on, but NOT going into the 1.3 milestone.\n\nAdditionally, `NewMounter()` and `NewUnmounter()` could be extracted to a `MountableVolumePlugin` type and `VolumeHost` could go through a similar fragmenting.\n\n@jingxu97 \n",
