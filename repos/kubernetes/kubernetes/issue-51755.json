  "body": "/kind bug\r\n\r\nWhen using the OpensStack cloud provider with cloud routes enabled instances will have their security groups removed when the allowed address pair is added to the instance's port.\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\nRun `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, and `kubelet` on OpenStack. Enable provisioning cloud routes in `kube-controller-manager` and configure the cloud config appropriately. The instance should have its security group removed when the allowed address pair is added.\r\n\r\nThis is due to a bug in gophercloud that has since been patched (See gophercloud/gophercloud#509).\r\n\r\nTo be honest I'm not sure how kubernetes handles scenarios like this (Workaround in code, update library, document manual workaround, etc), so I reported it just in case. Feel free to close this if it's in the wrong place/irrelevant.",
