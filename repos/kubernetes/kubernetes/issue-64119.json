Attachment was read-only.\r\nOnly 1 pod got the RBD mounted while the other POD failed with \"still in use\" in syslog, referencing the code in rbd_util.go that checks watchers.  Note that this is not the same thing as this:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63424\r\n\r\nwhich refers to persistent volumes.  This is not a persistent volume -the use case is to map read-only data to multiple containers from a single RBD, like for using a reference data set, etc.  According to the documentation this *should* work (see below).\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nI expect this to happen per the documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#rbd\r\n\r\n\"A feature of RBD is that it can be mounted as read-only by multiple consumers simultaneously. This means that you can pre-populate a volume with your dataset and then serve it in parallel from as many Pods as you need. Unfortunately, RBD volumes can only be mounted by a single consumer in read-write mode - no simultaneous writers allowed.\"\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nCreate 2 pods, each with 1 container mapping a single rbd read only.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n1.9.4\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\nself, x86_64 systems\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu Xenial\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\nLinux dal1util6p30 4.4.0-116-generic #140-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 12 21:23:04 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n- Install tools:\r\nceph\r\n- Others:\r\nI believe that in the case where a read-only mapping is being requested, the code should not check watchers.  Again this is consistent with the documentation but it doesn't work that way.  If a PV/PVC is the \"right\" way to do this it seems seriously overkill and the management overhead is severe, especially in a large scale environment.  The documentation states that the advantage of RBD is to be able to attach read-only volumes to multiple containers concurrently, and this is how I believe it should work.  The watcher check is artificial and really needs to apply only to read/write.  I can fix this bug myself but would like to understand the reasoning behind it a bit more.\r\nThanks!\r\nLeo Reiter",
