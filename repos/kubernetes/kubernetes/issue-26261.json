  "body": "When I run `git commit`, the command will call pre-commit hooks but sometimes it fails.  It shows `Timed out waiting for etcd`, but actually I can see the etcd running by `ps -ef | grep etcd`. Finally I find that I forget to set `export no_proxy` for localhost. (My building env is behind proxy, so I have to set http_proxy/https_proxy for internet connection).\n\nDo we need to set `export no_proxy=127.0.0.1,localhost` in the building scripts? If so, it would bring some convenience for developers who are behind proxy.\n\nI modify the `init.sh` [like this](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao/kubernetes/commit/6d2b72d3b9e7345a546fd238c78033cc0737f2dd),  it can work.\n\nhi @thockin , sorry to bother you, would you please check this? Thanks! If it's OK, I will create a PR.\n\n```\nChecking for swagger spec that need updating... !!!
