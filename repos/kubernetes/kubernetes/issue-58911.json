So if the volume was unformatted, the device mount operation will fail and return a verbose and obscure error messages. This message will appear in the events of according `Pod`.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nFor read only volume, if the device mount operation failed, we should check if it has been formatted or not, if not, we return a more human readable message, otherwise we return the mount operation error itself.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new volume(such as `ceph rbd`) manually or by dynamic provisioning\r\n2. Submit a `Pod` with this volume in its `Spec`, and set the `Spec.Volumes.ReadOnly` field to `true`\r\n3. Then the device mount operation will fail as this newly created volume hasn't been formatted yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n/sig storage\r\n/kind enhancement",
