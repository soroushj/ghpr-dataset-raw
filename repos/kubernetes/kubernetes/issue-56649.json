  "body": "/kind feature\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nThe DevicePlugins feature was introduced in 1.8 Kubernetes release as an alpha feature.\r\nSince then, we have seen good development work on stabling the feature as well as early adopters on using the framework to support device resources in Kubernetes.\r\nThis issue is to track the work requirements of entering this feature into beta.\r\nFYI, here is list of requirements from the OSS Kubernetes feature stage doc: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions\r\n\"\"\"\r\nBeta level:\r\nObject Versioning: API version name contains beta (e.g. v2beta3)\r\nAvailability: in official Kubernetes releases, and enabled by default\r\nAudience: users interested in providing feedback on features\r\nCompleteness: all API operations, CLI commands, and UI support should be implemented; end-to-end tests complete; the API has had a thorough API review and is thought to be complete, though use during beta may frequently turn up API issues not thought of during review\r\nUpgradeability: the object schema and semantics may change in a later software release; when this happens, an upgrade path will be documented; in some cases, objects will be automatically converted to the new version; in other cases, a manual upgrade may be necessary; a manual upgrade may require downtime for anything relying on the new feature, and may require manual conversion of objects to the new version; when manual conversion is necessary, the project will provide documentation on the process\r\nCluster Reliability: since the feature has e2e tests, enabling the feature via a flag should not create new bugs in unrelated features; because the feature is new, it may have minor bugs\r\nSupport: the project commits to complete the feature, in some form, in a subsequent Stable version; typically this will happen within 3 months, but sometimes longer; releases should simultaneously support two consecutive versions (e.g. v1beta1 and v1beta2; or v1beta2 and v1) for at least one minor release cycle (typically 3 months) so that users have enough time to upgrade and migrate objects\r\nRecommended Use Cases: in short-lived testing clusters; in production clusters as part of a short-lived evaluation of the feature in order to provide feedback\r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think we met most of the requirements here, with the commit that if we need to make incompatible API change in the future, we will document the upgrade path and if necessary, may support multiple API versions in a couple of releases.\r\n\r\nThings that I think would be nice to have to enter beta (entering beta may not necessary depends on their completeness)\r\n- Regarding to the thorough API review requirement, I think we had good discussions during the design proposal but there have been some recent discussions on whether we should use registration vs probe model for the general Kubelet plugin communication. I think we should have a general discussion on this topic with larger audience like people working on CSI plugins. I will create a FR issue to track this discussion soon.\r\n- We would like to see multiple device plugin implementations. We know some people have started working on device plugin implementations for Solarflare, FPGA, and Infiniband, and probably want to keep closer track on their progresses.\r\n\r\nWe would like to target this FR to 1.10. Please let us know your thoughts or add things that you think are critical to finish. Thanks!\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n",
