  "body": "Currently there's now way for a user to check what they entered in the DataSource field of a PVC create request.  In the past, this wasn't as confusing because if one were to submit invalid info (unsupported Kind) the verification checks would fail and the request would be rejected with a helpful message indicating why.\r\n\r\nAs of 1.14 that's no longer the case, a user is able to put anything they wish in these fields and the create is performed and they get a PVC, and there's no way for them to see what is or isn't set.\r\n\r\nAdding output of DataSource to `describe pvc` would be useful, not only for invalid cases where the input might just get eaten, but also for users to have the ability to check for originating sources of their PVCs.",
