End result is that k8s is trying to attach a volume in a loop but never succeeds because it is already attached to a downed node.  I've waited for more than an hour for the volume to be detached (didn't help :c)\n\n**What you expected to happen**:\nI expect controller-manager or kubelet to detach volume before trying to attach it to a new compute instance. \n\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\nBring up cluster with two nodes on openstack. Schedule pod with a pvc. Shutdown (from the command line on the operating system) the node with attached volume. Pod gets rescheduled to another node, but volume stays with the downed node.\n\n**Anything else do we need to know**:\nI've looked through reconcile.go on both kubelet and controller-manager it seems to me that once a node is downed it is no longer on the list of nodesManaged (in desired_state_of_world.go) so it's volume is never going to be detached. I've also tried to disable --enable-controller-attach-detach on a kubelet, but it doesn't try to detach it either.\n",
