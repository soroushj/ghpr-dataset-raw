The scheduler uses this generation number to update its snapshot of the cache. When generation numbers of the snapshot and the cached nodes are the same, scheduler knows that its snapshot is up to date. The problem is that if a node is deleted and then added back with the same name, there is a potential collision of the generation number that existed in the scheduler's snapshot and that of the newly added node. If such collision happens, the scheduler believes that its snapshot is up to date and keeps using it until the generation number changes. This can cause scheduler to use stale data from its stale snapshot. Although the probability of such collision is low, it occurred consistently in one of our tests and took me a very long time to find what the root-cause was.\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n/assign\r\n",
