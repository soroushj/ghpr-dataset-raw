Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nWhen a PVC is created and the PV mounted into a Pod using the StorageOS in-tree volume driver, the StorageOS CLI & UI do not report that the volume is mounted.  \r\n\r\nThe PV is created and mounted into the Pod successfully, and all k8s functionality works as expected.  However, since the correct mount status is not visible to administrators using the StorageOS UI or CLI, they may make changes to or delete a mounted volume without realising, and the safeguards (must use `--force` to delete a mounted volume) do not trigger.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression caused by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69782, released in 1.14.0.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nThe StorageOS CLI should report volume mount information (node name, mount timestamp).\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n1. Install StorageOS node containers with CSI disabled: https://docs.storageos.com/docs/platforms/kubernetes/install/1.13\r\n2. Provision application Pod with a PVC using the StorageOS StorageClass: https://github.com/storageos/deploy/tree/master/k8s/examples/redis\r\n3. Run StorageOS to list volumes: `storageos volume ls`\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.14.0 and later\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: any\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`): any linux (incl. Ubuntu 18.04)\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): any linux (incl. 4.15.0-33-generic)\r\n- Install tools: any (incl. minikube)\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug): N/A\r\n- Others: Requires StorageOS deployment\r\n\r\n/sig storage\r\n/assign",
