  "body": "`KUBE_API_VERSIONS` is an attempt to control the available serialization of types.  It pre-dates the idea that we'll have separate schemes, so it's not a thing that makes sense anymore.\r\n\r\nServer-side we've had a very clear message about breaks in the logs for a year [\"KUBE_API_VERSIONS is only for testing. Things will break.\"](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blame/master/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/server.go#L487).\r\n\r\nClient-side it became progressively more broken as we moved to generic types for CRUD more than a year ago.  What is registered doesn't matter when everything is unstructured.\r\n\r\nWe should remove this piece of legacy since it doesn't behave predictable server-side or client-side.\r\n\r\n@smarterclayton @lavalamp \r\n@kubernetes/sig-api-machinery-bugs ",
