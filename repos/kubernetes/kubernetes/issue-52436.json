  "body": "**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nTraditionally, we charge to quota all pods that are in a non-terminal phase. We have a user report that noted the behavior change in kube 1.5 for the node controller to no longer force delete pods whose nodes have been lost. Instead, the pod is marked for deletion, and the reason is updated to state that the node is unreachable. The user expected the quota to be released. If the user was at their quota limit, their application may not be able to create a new replica given the current behavior.",
