  "body": "## Who is using container log stats?\r\n1. Summary API provides container log disk usage. https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/apis/stats/v1alpha1/types.go#L121\r\n2. Ephemeral storage based eviction is using container log disk usage.\r\n\r\n## Who is collecting container log stats?\r\nCadvisor is collecting per-container log stats for docker today. See https://github.com/google/cadvisor/blob/master/container/docker/handler.go#L182.\r\nHowever, we could not do that for CRI container log, because all CRI container logs are in a same pod directory, we don't have a per-container directory for cadvisor to collect container log stats.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary work around, we could point cadvisor to the container log file, as what cri-o is doing today. https://github.com/google/cadvisor/blob/master/container/crio/handler.go#L131-L138\r\nHowever, this won't work after we add log rotation for CRI container logs.\r\n\r\n## Things need discussion\r\n1) Do we need per-container log stats in core metrics?\r\n* Option 1: Still support per-container log stats in core metrics. Then we should figure out a way to collect per-container log stats for CRI container runtime. Should we create a sub directory for each container in pod log directory?\r\n* Option 2: Only support per-pod log stats in core metrics. This is more straight forward based on today's CRI log directory format. However, we still need to resolve:\r\n  * How does separate monitoring pipeline get per-container log stats?\r\n  * How to deal with the regression / behavior change introduced by this change? (summary api, eviction)\r\n\r\n2) Who should collect container log stats in the future?\r\n* Option 1: Cadvisor + Container runtime? It seems redundant to me that CRI container runtimes still need to integrate with cadvisor independently, when their log path and format are the same.\r\n* Option 2: Kubelet + Cadvisor? Kubelet could call cadvisor library and get CRI log stats. Or kubelet could configure cadvisor properly to let cadvisor collect CRI log stats.\r\nIf it's still cadvisor, should different container runtime integrate with cadvisor\r\n\r\n@dchen1107 @yujuhong @dashpole @jingxu97 @abhi @mrunalp \r\n@kubernetes/sig-node-feature-requests @kubernetes/sig-instrumentation-misc ",
