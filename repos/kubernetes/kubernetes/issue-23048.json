  "body": "in volumes.go there is a generic error variable defined that is used when a failure occurs and no other error is surfaced, it is a catch-all when something goes wrong.\n\n```\nvar errUnsupportedVolumeType = fmt.Errorf(\"unsupported volume type\")\n```\n\nThink this should be reworded to something that is more reflective of the true issue and not so confusing for users.  This error mostly comes when a builder can not be created and it is typically not true that the volume type is unsupported, but rather some other underlying issue, such as missing secrets or endpoints or etc...\n\npropose something like:\n\n```\n\"failed volume mount, check previous pod describe events or logs for more details\"  \n```\n\nor\n\n```\n\"volume mount error - make sure the volume type is supported and also check previous pod describe events or logs for a more accurate root cause explanation\"\n```\n",
