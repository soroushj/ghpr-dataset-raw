  "body": "Forked from #35159\n# Problem\n\nCurrently a generated golang [clientset](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/client/clientset_generated/release_1_5) only includes code for one API version of each API group (e.g., [release_1_5 clientset](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/client/clientset_generated/release_1_5) only supports [batch/v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/client/clientset_generated/release_1_5/typed/batch/v1), but not batch/v2alpha1).\n\nWe designed it this way to spare users the trouble of selecting a version. However, this design is preventing us from migrating kubernetes components to use versioned clientset, for these reasons:\n- It forces all components to move to use a new API version at the same time, defeating a main benefit of migrating to versioned objects.\n- kube-controller-manager needs multiple versions. For example, the ScheduelJob controller needs to use v2alpha1.Job, but the Job controller needs to use v1.Job, otherwise `Job` stops working when admin turns off batch/v2alpha1 (but leaves batch/v1 on) on the api server.\n# Proposed changes to clientset\n\nA clientset will include multiple API versions of an API group. Its public interface will be changed:\n- We'll add methods to select API version if a group have multiple versions, e.g., `clientset.BatchV1().Job()` returns `v1.Job`, and `clientset.BatchV2alpha1().Job()` returns `v2alpha1.Job`.\n- If the caller doesn't pick a version, it will get the default version, e.g., `clientset.Batch().Job()` returns `v1.Job`, as it does today.\n- If a group only has one version, we don't change its interface.\n\nRegarding how many versions to include in a release of clientset, I currently plan to keep at most two stable versions of a group, and remove alpha or beta versions when they are removed from the kubernetes repository.\n\n@kubernetes/sig-api-machinery @mml @liggitt \n",
