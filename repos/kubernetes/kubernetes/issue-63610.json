  "body": "Based on discussion on slack with @deads2k ,\r\n\r\nEarlier, we were using the c-m qps wrongly in GC. The qps limit was enforced per resource type as opposed to globally for the GC.\r\nSo with the old behavior, if you set 10 QPS and had 30 resources, you'd actually have 300 qps.  if you had added more CRDs and aggregated APIs to 80 resources, the same config would then potentially have 800 qps.  With the new code, the QPS stays constant instead of scaling out based on unrelated values.\r\n\r\nThis change which was made in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63444 broke our scale tests as all of a sudden the GC feels starved of qps.\r\nWe need to:\r\n\r\n- tune the defaults to have similar behaviour as earlier\r\n- think about other consequences of increasing this qps (e.g on other controllers, etc)\r\n\r\ncc @kubernetes/sig-api-machinery-bugs @kubernetes/sig-scalability-misc @deads2k @lavalamp @liggitt ",
