  "body": "**What would you like to be added**:\r\nCurrently, `pkg/kubelet/util/boottime_util_linux.go` does not have unit test coverage. Specifically, there's no unit test coverage for `GetBootTime`. I'd like to see unit test coverage added for `GetBootTime`. See `pkg/kubelet/util/util_unix_test.go` for a sample of how to write platform specific unit tests.\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\nThere's a fairly small chance of `GetBootTime` being modified, and thus breaking, in the future without this added test coverage. However, it should be relatively straightforward to add the test coverage, and could make a good first issue for a new contributor. There's also the added benefit that it helps keep the test coverage in `pkg/kubelet` high :) And we never know, it might help catch a bug some day :)\r\n\r\nExtra note\r\n\r\nI think this ticket could be a great candidate for someone who is new to\r\ncontributing to sig-node/k8s. **I'd prefer to please give first dibs for picking\r\nthis up to any folks who are currently underrepresented in the k8s community.** Please reach out to @mattjmcnaughton on k8s Slack (or post directly in #sig-node and tag me) if you're interested, and I'll assign you the issue. I'm happy to mentor and be helpful in whatever way I can :)\r\n",
