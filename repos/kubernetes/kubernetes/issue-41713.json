  "body": "The PR https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41703 fixed hollow npd. Now hollow npd can work properly. However, I found that npd can't update node condition, and keep reporting error:\r\n```\r\nE0219 10:05:23.100125       1 manager.go:160] failed to update node conditions: nodes \"hollow-node-w9fkf\" not found\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that hollow kubelet never registers the node.\r\n\r\nI checked the hollow kubelet. Most of them are empty, but in some of them I saw tons of the following log:\r\n```\r\n0219 09:59:54.303624       9 file.go:72] unable to read config path \"/tmp/hollow-kubelet.037396831/manifest013003570\": unable to create i\r\nnotify: inotify_init: too many open files\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW, we really need hollow node log. I can't reproduce this in my own kubemark cluster, I can only wait for the kubemark test running, and login into the running node to get some debug information.\r\n\r\n/cc @shyamjvs @wojtek-t @gmarek ",
