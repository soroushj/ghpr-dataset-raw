Then I looked more closely at index.go, and realized that it has a dichotomy but botches the naming and discussion of it.  The dichotomy is between what that file sometimes calls \"values\" and some of what it calls \"keys\".  An `IndexFunc` maps an object to a set of \"values\".  The `IndexKeys` method of an `Indexer` maps `(a, b)` to a slice of keys and an error, where `a` names an index and `b` is a \"value\".  Specifically, the resulting slice of keys are those whose corresponding object is mapped by the named `IndexFunc` to a set of \"values\" that includes `b`.  But the name used for this second parameter (which I have called `b` here) is `indexKey`.  Instead it should be something more like `indexValue`.  The `ByIndex` method has the same parameter naming problem.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): all of them\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n",
