  "body": "/kind feature\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\nI tried to use `make test` to run the podautoscaler tests, with `make test WHAT=pkg/controller/podautoscaler`. I got the error message \r\n```\r\ncan't load package: package pkg/controller/podautoscaler: cannot find package \"pkg/controller/podautoscaler\" in any of: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue was that because I was specifying the package path relative to my current directory, as opposed to $GOPATH, I needed to append a `./` to my path dir. The command should have been `make test WHAT=./pkg/controller/podautoscaler`.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nIt would have been great to get a helpful message from `make test`. For example, \"it appears you specified your package path relative to your current directory - try running this command again with \"./\" prepended to the path\". I would think that `hack/make-rules/test.sh` could do a relatively easy calculation to check if you incorrectly specified the path (i.e. does it not exist at $GOPATH but does exist from the current dir).\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n`make test WHAT=pkg/controller/podautoscaler`\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nI'd be happy to submit a pr for this if it would be helpful :)\r\n\r\n/sig contributor-experience\r\n",
