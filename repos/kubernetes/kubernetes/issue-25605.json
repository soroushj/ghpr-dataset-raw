  "body": "Readiness is as relevant to daemonsets as deployments, but while DeploymentStatus has \"AvailableReplicas\" i.e. the number of pods ready for at least minReadySeconds, DaemonsetStatus does not have an equivalent count of replicas that are healthy/ready. Not only can services point at daemonset pods, making readiness relevant, but readiness can also be used to indicate general health. I suggest adding \"readyReplicas\" to DaemonsetStatus.\n\nThe main use case should be for kubectl, but I also would like to add a metric to [kubernetes/kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/) reflecting ready replicas of a daemonset, as it exists for deployments.\n",
