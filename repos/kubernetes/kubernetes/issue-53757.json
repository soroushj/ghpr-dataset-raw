  "body": "Today, CRI only provides information needed by Kubelet.\r\n\r\nBut actually, Kubelet is not the only consumer of CRI. [`crilctl`](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-tools/blob/master/docs/crictl.md), which is a CLI tool for debugging purpose, also talks with CRI to get debug information for user.\r\n\r\nMost operations provided in `crictl` are well covered by CRI already. The only thing missing is detailed debug information about `container`, `sandbox`, `image` and `container runtime` itself (think about `docker inspect` and `docker info`). For linux container based container runtime, it could be `Pid`, `Namespaces`, `Container Config` etc.\r\n\r\nSince we want `crictl` to be portable across different CRI container runtimes, it has to get the debug information from CRI instead of from the underlying container runtime directly.\r\n\r\nIdeally,\r\n- Each container runtime should be able to provide runtime specific debug information via CRI.\r\n- Kubelet should never consume that information.\r\n- `crictl` should easily format and print the debug information to user.\r\n\r\n**The debug information could just be a string in `json` format**, which could be easily combined, converted and printed.\r\n\r\nAs for how to expose the debug information through CRI, there are several options:\r\n- **Option 1:** Add a `ContainerInfo` field in `ContainerStatusResponse`, and also corresponding fields in `PodSandboxStatusResponse`, `ImageStatusResponse` and `StatusResponse`. The `ContainerInfo` is just a string in json format.\r\n  - Pros: Won't break existing CRI container runtime. If they don't want to provide this, they could just return empty.\r\n  - Cons: This introduces extra overhead in each status call, the extra encoding/decoding in grpc will be a pain. And the more debug information a container runtime provides, the worse its performance is, which doesn't seem like an encouragement to more debug info.\r\n- **Option 2 (Preferred):** Same with Option 1, but add a `Debug bool` option in `ContainerStatusRequest`, and also other status requests. Container runtime should only provide extra debug information when `Debug=true`.\r\n  - Pros: Extra debug information doesn't add extra performance overhead in production.\r\n  - Cons: The `Debug` option may be confusing to people, we may need another name.\r\n- **Option 3:** Add separate CRI functions for the debug information.\r\n  - Pros: More clear.\r\n  - Cons: All CRI runtimes need to support these functions, at least need to return `not implemented` for those functions.\r\n- **Option 4:** Separate CRI debug API. `crictl` should only use it when it is present, and just use CRI if it isn't.\r\n  - Pros: Clean. The original CRI won't be affected at all.\r\n  - Cons: More complex than option 2.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer option 2, but am open to other options. :)\r\n\r\n@yujuhong @feiskyer @mikebrow @abhi @mrunalp @runcom \r\n/cc @dchen1107 \r\n/cc @kubernetes/sig-node-api-reviews ",
