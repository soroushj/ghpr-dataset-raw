  "body": "If you set relatively short `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`, let's say 60 seconds (or generally anything less than full resync time which is 10 mins) and your job stabilizes after few initial seconds, iow. now new pods are created or anything involving job controller, you end up waiting more than 10 minutes before the Job is actually killed due to exceeding ADS. \nThe reason for that is that controller synchronizes objects only when job itself or underlying pod changes. Or, when full resync is performed once 10 mins. This leads to unnecessarily wait that longer timeout. \n\nPossible fixes:\n1. Mark jobs with ADS set and have them full resynced more often.\n2. Queue jobs with ADS set, so they are resynced more often.\n   \n   Other possibilities?\n\n@erictune @janetkuo ideas?\n",
