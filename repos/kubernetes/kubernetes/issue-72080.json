  "body": "**What would you like to be added**:\r\n\r\n`test/e2e/storage/testsuites` creates volumes dynamically. Initially, the size of those volumes was hard-coded in the test, which prevented using the tests with storage backends that couldn't support that hard-coded size.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70862 introduces a mechanism where the driver for the storage backend can set the size.\r\n\r\nBut this still has the problem that the size chosen by the driver might not work for some tests. A better solution would be to let the driver and each test specify a size range, then when setting up the volume for a specific test, the actual size gets chosen by looking at the intersection.\r\n\r\n**Why is this needed**:\r\n\r\nSome tests might fail when the chosen size is too small or too large? Mostly a theoretic issue at this point, it hasn't happened in practice yet.\r\n\r\n/kind feature\r\n",
