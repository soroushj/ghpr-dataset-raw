  "body": "The effect of CPU throttling is non obvious to users and throws them off when they try out kubernetes. It also complicates CPU capacity planning for pods. Pods that are carefully placed in Guaranteed QoS class are typically of higher priority than other pods, and these pods are expected to get the best performance. On the other hand, Burstable pods may have to be limited in certain environments to avoid tail latencies for Guaranteed pods.\r\nI propose we avoid setting CPU limits on Guaranteed pods by default and continue to impose CPU limits on Burstable pods. We can provide a config option to ease the rollout in existing clusters. Users may need time to handle this transition, and some of them may choose to use the existing policies. \r\n\r\nClosely related is static CPU pinning policies in kubelet which will naturally limit Guaranteed pods to specific cores if they request integral number of cores. This feature may be combined with turning off CPU limiting for Guaranteed pods. That said, having an ability to configure each of these feature independently will still be helpful.\r\n\r\n@derekwaynecarr we have discussed this in the past, but AFAIK, an issue hasn't been filed thus far. @dchen1107 thoughts? \r\n\r\nIf there is a general agreement that this is the intended direction longer term, I can post a patch to make CPU limit policies configurable.\r\n\r\n@kubernetes/sig-node-feature-requests ",
