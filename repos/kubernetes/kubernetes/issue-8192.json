  "body": "#7567 adds the ability to migrate etcd keys to a new prefix. This is fine, but it'll be tricky to use once apiserver is HA. We should either document the proper steps (shut down all apiservers, run a single apiserver with the right command to do the migration, shut down that apiserver, start all apiservers again), or (my preference) remove it. IMO it should not have gone in at all; you should use a specific tool to do the migration after shutting down all apiservers. There's no need to build that into apiserver, and in fact, it's dangerous if used incorrectly.\n",
