  "body": "**What this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n\r\nCurrently, RBD plugin does `rbd lock/map` and `format/mount` in one `Mounter.Setup` call. If `format/mount` fails, the `Mounter.Setup` fails, no `Unmouter.TearDown` will be executed, `rbd lock/map` cannot be undone.\r\n\r\nThe lock can be cleaned up when the image is to be locked next time because it's an orphaned lock (no watcher on the image). But `rbd map` will be impossible to be undone. The image will be mapped on the node forever, which will cause the PV cannot be deleted (still be used by a node). \r\n\r\nIn this PR I fix it by undoing `rbd lock/map` immediately if `format/mount` fails. \r\n\r\nOf course, this is not a perfect solution, but it's the only way I can figure out. It reduces problems that may occur. It's better if we can split the `Mounter.Setup` process into `Attacher.Attach` and `Mounter.Setup`. But RBD plugin cannot implement `Attacher` interface currently, due to it cannot get secret string in `attacher.Attacher` call if user specified `secretName` under their namespace (do know which namespace to get the secret).\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\nI had tried to implement `Attacher` interface, but found it's impossible (due the reason above). But I think this issue should be fixed. Pass Pod/User information in `Attacher.Attach` or add `secretNamespace` field in RBD volume spec? \r\n\r\n**Release note**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @rootfs ",
