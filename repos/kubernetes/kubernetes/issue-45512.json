(cc @nicksardo)\r\n\r\nCould this be something related to the go1.8 upgrade which happened around the same time? (ref https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/45216)\r\nAnd besides loadbalancer, we have kube-proxy OOM'ing too in the other 40% of the cases, but that seems to be an older issue (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44613).\r\n\r\ncc @k8s-mirror-scalability-bugs @wojtek-t @gmarek ",
