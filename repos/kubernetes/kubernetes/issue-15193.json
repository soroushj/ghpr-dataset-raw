How many examples need to illustrate the same concepts/features?\n- What techniques do we want to use to make the examples engaging: interactivity, rewards, etc.?\n- Does it need to be a realistic application configuration (e.g., HA)?\n- Should the example demonstrate the application being used?\n- System best practices\n  - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/config-best-practices.md\n    - Show individual files and then combined files?\n  - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/pods.md#durability-of-pods-or-lack-thereof\n    - Show singleton pods and then demonstrate why controllers are needed for self-healing?\n  - Secret\n- Cross references to other documentation (e.g., concept and feature documentation)\n- Consistent organization (e.g., should the summary appear at the beginning or the end?)\n- Keeping examples up to date with new features and evolving conventions\n- Repo locations for text vs. config and code\n- Whether/how to show multiple solutions (e.g., kubectl run and yaml)\n- Shell command format (e.g., prompt or no prompt)\n- kubectl output or not\n- Screenshots\n- How to make it possible to run examples without cloning the whole repo\n- System addons that can be assumed (e.g., DNS)\n- Examples that show the cluster being created and destroyed in addition to deploying the application\n- Cloud-provider-specific examples vs. portable examples\n- Unit and end-to-end testing of the examples\n\ncc @aronchick \n",
