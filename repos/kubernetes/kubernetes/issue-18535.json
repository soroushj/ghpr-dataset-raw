  "body": "I've done a bunch of searching for an answer to this but don't see a real solution. If you're running with the [currently recommended](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/admin/high-availability.md#load-balancing) solution for multiple api servers they continuously update the kubernetes service endpoint. This doesn't _really_ cause any problems until you try to use the Ingress resource since the endpoint modification causes the ingress controller (at least the haproxy one, I don't see any reason why the same wouldn't be true of any other) to continuously restart.\n\nIt also spams the kube-proxy logs with:\n\n```\nkube-proxy[1580]: I1210 21:44:08.572592    1580 proxier.go:352] Setting endpoints for \"default/kubernetes:\" to [10.0.167.163:443]\n```\n\nevery couple seconds.\n\nIt looks like #8649 is the latest attempted fix, however (at least on AWS) there's no address to advertise since ELBs aren't static IPs. #6672 references #6995 but neither of those end up in real solutions. #7273 looks like it was exactly what I'm looking for but then #7704 seems to have removed it without any explanation that I saw.\n\nThis is all a really long winded way to say, what's the real recommended way to run multiple API servers?\n",
