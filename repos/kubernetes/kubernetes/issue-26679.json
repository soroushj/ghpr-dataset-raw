  "body": "Needed as a follow-up to #26351 \n\nMost of the currently supported clouds that offer special volume types provide a deterministic way to determine the path that a volumes is attached to on a node. (GCE, OpenStack, VSphere).  There is at least one cloud that does not - AWS.  For AWS, this information is only available via an API call.  In order to facilitate AWS and future clouds that do not offer such a deterministic way to know the path of a volume, a mechanism is needed to store the path where a volume is attached to a host when that host's volumes are managed by the attach/detach controller, so that the Kubelet has enough information to mount the attached volume for a pod(s) to use without requiring credentials on the node.\n\n@saad-ali and I discussed using an annotation on the volume, perhaps `kubernetes.io/attach-path`.  Example:\n\n``` yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolume\nmetadata:\n  name: pv-1gb\n  labels:\n    type: ebs\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/attach-path: /dev/xvd1\nspec:\n  capacity:\n    storage: 1Gi\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteMany\n  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain\n  awsElasticBlockStore:\n    volumeID: vol-YYYYY\n    fsType: xfs\n```\n\nWhen a node is managed by the attach/detach controller, the Kubelet will need to wait for this annotation to be present on the volume before mounting it.\n\n@kubernetes/sig-storage \n",
