There would be azure disks could not be usable since /dev/sd* changed\r\nUpdate:\r\nIt seems that on azure china, this issue could repro very easily.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nI have checked the official doc: [Troubleshoot Linux VM device name change](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/troubleshoot-device-names-problems)\r\n`device names could be changed after you restart a Linux VM or reattach the data disks`\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): from v1.6.0 to v1.10.0\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n\r\n/sig azure\r\n/assign\r\n\r\n@rootfs @brendandburns @khenidak\r\n@kubernetes/sig-azure-misc \r\nI am working on a fix for this issue, would use `/dev/disk/by-id/` instead  of `/de/sd*`",
