  "body": "Recently profile collection has been added to our scalability tests. While running the kubemark-500 presubmit, @wojtek-t noticed from the memory allocation profile that an unusually large amount of allocations (~10GB) were being done by `k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/errors.aggregate.Error()` during load test. See - https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-kubemark-500-gce/11932/artifacts/profiles/ApiserverMemoryProfile_load.pdf\r\n\r\nAfter he added some logging, I took a look at the [apiserver logs](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/pull/59807/pull-kubernetes-kubemark-e2e-gce-big/10/artifacts/e2e-10-kubemark-master/kube-apiserver.log) and it seems like there are a huge no. of such errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nE0213 15:42:17.454988       7 errors.go:207] AAA (Endpoints load-medium-15-svc) subsets[0].addresses[0].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-xnsk2\r\nE0213 15:42:17.482183       7 errors.go:207] AAA (Endpoints load-medium-15-svc) [subsets[0].addresses[0].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-xnsk2, subsets[0].addresses[1].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-xbnqv]\r\nE0213 15:42:17.549520       7 errors.go:207] AAA (Endpoints load-medium-15-svc) [subsets[0].addresses[0].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-xnsk2, subsets[0].addresses[1].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-xbnqv, subsets[0].addresses[3].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-tx2x9]\r\nE0213 15:42:17.552956       7 errors.go:207] AAA (Endpoints load-medium-15-svc) [subsets[0].addresses[0].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-ztq89, subsets[0].addresses[1].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-xnsk2, subsets[0].addresses[2].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-xbnqv, subsets[0].addresses[4].nodeName: Forbidden: Cannot change NodeName for 2.3.4.5 to hollow-node-tx2x9]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn digging up a bit I observed few things:\r\n- These errors seem to be arising from `PUT endpoints` calls made by the ep-controller\r\n- The first PUT call for every endpoints object succeeds (i.e 200), and all the subsequent PUTs for it fail with 422\r\n- Because of the above, we never go above a single backend in the endpoints object (I verified this from a live kubemark cluster)\r\n- These error msgs grow linearly as more and more backends try to be put into the endpoints object. As a result we're seeing a cumulative O(N^2) allocs for the error msgs, where N is the no. of backends in the service. \r\n\r\n@kubernetes/sig-scalability-misc @wojtek-t ",
