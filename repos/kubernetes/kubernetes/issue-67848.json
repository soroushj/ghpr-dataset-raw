We had to set `backoffLimit: 1` in order to get the pod to run.\r\n\r\nThe wording in the docs suggest that `backoffLimit` should only take effect when the pod is finished/or failed. It shouldn't cap starting the initial pod.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nRun the following job spec in 1.9.x and 1.10.x:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: batch/v1\r\nkind: Job\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: pi-with-timeout\r\nspec:\r\n  backoffLimit: 0\r\n  activeDeadlineSeconds: 100\r\n  template:\r\n    spec:\r\n      containers:\r\n      - name: pi\r\n        image: perl\r\n        command: [\"perl\",  \"-Mbignum=bpi\", \"-wle\", \"print bpi(2000)\"]\r\n      restartPolicy: OnFailure\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nThe docs links this existing ticket saying `backofflimit` is ineffective with `restartPolicy: OnFailure`, but the ticket talks about restarting too many times, not never starting a pod.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/54870\r\n\r\nGiven this issue was slightly different, I originally did not think it was a backoffPolicy bug.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\nTested on 1.9.7 and 1.10.6\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\nAWS\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\nFedora 28\r\n",
