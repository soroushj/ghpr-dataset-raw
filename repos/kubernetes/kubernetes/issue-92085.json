  "body": "\nThe purpose of the `SECURITY_CONTACTS` file for each Kubernetes repository is to provide a list of people who can assist the Kubernetes [Product Security Committe](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/committee-product-security) in the event that a security issue related to the repository is discovered or disclosed.  As described in the file, those on the list should agree to our [Embargo Policy](https://git.k8s.io/security/private-distributors-list.md#embargo-policy).\n\nPlease update the [`/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/SECURITY_CONTACTS`](/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/SECURITY_CONTACTS) file for the apimachinery repository. After finding people who are willing to work in this capacity, you should add them to the list, then remove PSC members (except any PSC member will be working as a security contact for this repository). The list is GitHub usernames, optionally followed by an email address. If no email address is listed, the PSC will use the email address found on git commits made by the listed user.\n\nThe file may already have people listed who are secuirty contacts. In that case, simply remove any PSC members who aren't also security contacts for the repo.\n\nSee https://github.com/kubernetes/security/issues/92 for more information\n\n/area security\n/committee product-security\n/kind cleanup\n/lifecycle frozen\n/priority important-soon\n/sig api-machinery\n",
