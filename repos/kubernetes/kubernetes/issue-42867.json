Care needs to be taken to make sure we don't flood the event log.  Maybe only have an event when the mount is successful, and not the attach.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):\r\nCreate a deployment that uses a GCE PD volume, and move it to different nodes in order to cause the volume to need to be detached and attached to different nodes.\r\n\r\ncc @kubernetes/sig-storage-bugs \r\n",
