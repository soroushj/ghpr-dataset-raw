The devices may not be in the ready state until the device plugin re-registers. The current Kubelet device manager implementation always tries to re-use the cached state. In case of pure node reboot, Kubelet device manager would rebuild its cached state from local checkpoint file, which means it could admit a previously started pod that requests a device plugin resource before the corresponding device plugin re-registers. This could cause undesired behavior that containers might be started without the corresponding resource being ready.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Others:\r\n\r\n/sig node",
