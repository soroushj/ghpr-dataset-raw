  "body": "I walked through the getting started guide in [docker.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/getting-started-guides/docker.md) and I find it too complicated (assuming it's supposed to be the easiest and recommended way to play with K8s).\n\nSome of the problems I've noticed so far:\n- Requirements are hard to verify - we require some kernel configuration which I don't how to check without googling it\n- We 3 very long commands which are very hard to parse even using docker reference (they do not fit on 30\" screen!)\n- Some command outputs are outdated\n\nIt's also hard for someone to use kubectl as it doesn't have a context and it's not easy to set it correctly (it's minimum 2 commands which are relatively long)\n\nI think our goal should be that we have a very simple command `run_local_kubernetes.sh` that will setup everything (and will verify requirements). Second command should be already starting a pod with a working `kubectl`.\n\n@brendandburns \n",
