  "body": "/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nWhen setting an elbSecurityGroup in cloud.config for AWS, and deploying multiple services with differing ports, then the security group rules flap in AWS, causing services to become inaccessible (only one will be correctly configured at a time).\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nI expect that the configured elbSecurityGroup's rules will not be touched at all.  It must be pre-configured to permit access.  Alternatively, all ports for all services are queried and managed together.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nMost people are not running large clusters which may hit the AWS limits, so they won't use this option, nor see this issue.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): 1.7.1\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: AWS\r\n- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CentOS 7\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): 4.10.13-1-ARCH\r\n- Install tools: Custom\r\n- Others:\r\n",
