  "body": "I am experiencing frequent hangs on large transfers (> 12 KB)  between nodes when using the pod network;  that is, between 10.246.x.n and 10.246.y.m for x != y.   The larger the transfer the more likely the hang.  I first noticed the problem on http responses of 33 kb, which hang at about the 12 kb mark 50% time and succeed the rest of the time.  Larger transfers hang more frequently but always at about the 12 kb mark. I see the problem with both http and ssh (scp) transfers.  I see the problem for all four combinations of (node,pod) on one node to (node,pod) on another.  I see the problem for master to minion and minion to minion transfers.\n\nI do not see any problem within a single node (10.246.x.n to 10.246.x.m).  I do not see any problem when using the host network (10.245 addresses).\n\nI have tried Kubernetes 1.0.5 using Vagrant 1.7.4 and VirtualBox 5.0.2 on a Mac host, as well as Kubernetes 1.0.6 using Vagrant 1.7.4 and VirtualBox 5.0.4 on a Linux host.  Both show the same problem.  I even tried switching the os for the vagrant nodes from Fedora 21 to 22.  That caused lots of other problems, but this network hanging issue was still there.\n\nI looked at the network traffic using Wireshark.  When the problem occurred, an ICMP redirect message would be sent from the pod ip of the host node (10.246.x.1) to the pod ip of the server (10.246.x.4 in my case) redirecting the stream to the host ip of the destination (10.246.y.1) (which was also the destination).  This was immediately followed by a retransmission of the original packet with the same IP addresses (i.e. from 10.246.x.4 to 10.246.y.1) but with different mac addresses.  Wireshark flagged this second packet as a retransmission.\n\nThe same sequence of 3 packets would then repeat periodically (except Wireshark would flag both data packets as retransmissions).\n",
